In regards to transportation agreements, Child Welfare is currently analyzing a group of foster youth and their transportation needs as part of a pilot which will impact a final draft of a transportation agreement between the agency and our local school districts. FYSCP updated its board policies pertaining to high school graduation requirements and waivers for our court and community schools including AB 216 (foster), homeless, immigrant, migrant, and students from military families. Our Foster Focus database is more fully utilized as the Sacramento COE continues to add features to the program including all FYSCP, services, FAFSA support, and more recently a school stability pilot which ACOE is a participant. In addition, FYSCP facilitates the transfer of school records, insures that IEP's are updated, and assists in analyzing high school transcripts. Education case management services are provided by five staff. All FYSCP staff review available data to help determine areas of academic need by reviewing outcomes from Dashboards and DataQuest. More recently, we have gained access to post-secondary outcomes with data provided by CalPASS. Local community needs and feedback are solicited yearly. In 2019, statewide, all FYSCP's were given an educational needs survey to disseminate to its local partners.|2019-10-15|Met|2019

03100330000000|Amador County Office of Education|10|4|4|5|2|5|3|3|3|Foster youth are the most at risk student population in Amador County Office of Education (ACOE). However, our participation in the Foster Youth Services Coordinating Program (FYSCP) is allowing us to increase our students’ access to resources. We have identified a subgroup of our Foster Youth that stands out as being even more at-risk. This subgroup is made up of youth who have had many different foster and home placements along with school changes. This creates extreme obstacles in the ability to continue with the school of origin and often results in educational gaps, increased educational and behavioral needs, and exposure to continuous trauma. In response to this continuous trauma ACOE, in collaboration with our county agencies, has worked to provide training for staff and community members in trauma-informed practices. There are many trainings offered for staff and community members by the FYSCP and our local agencies such as Resilient Amador, Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACES) trainings, and Youth Mental Health First Aid to name a few. Trauma-informed staff and community members have increased positive interactions with our foster youth and other youth impacted by trauma in their lives. The Foster Liaison attends multi-disciplinary team meetings bi-weekly at the department of behavioral health. Through these meetings, we are able to work together as a community to leverage resources and collaborate about the foster youth that we serve.|2019-11-06|Met|2019

34103480000000|Sacramento County Office of Education|10|5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5|SCOE's Foster Youth Services Department monitors foster youth academic engagement and enrollment daily using ourFoster Focus system. This innovative system was awarded a Golden Bell at the 36th annual California School Boards Association conference, operates as a network throughout the state. The system makes it possible for users to retrieve daily refreshed data to help monitor and intervene to improve the education outcomes of foster youth.  High mobility often threatens the education outcomes of youth in foster care. As a child moves from school to school, important academic records can lag behind or become lost. Designated school districts, CPS, and probation may access Foster Focus and instantly retrieve student data, resulting in immediate and appropriate enrollment and placement, and a smoother transition.  Upon completion, a centralized Registrar contacts SCOE to ensure appropriate services are provided. This includes coordination of any outside services such as drug and alcohol counseling, anger management classes, mental health services, and possibly parenting classes for teen parents. SCOE leads or participates in multi-agency teams that lead service delivery for foster youth. This is done in cooperation with district placement officers, child welfare professionals, juvenile courts judges and staff, and mental health agencies. Each team meets quarterly to share data and coordinate services to ensure the transfer of health and education records for foster youth.|2019-10-15|Met|2019

We also sent notifications to schools for students who entered foster care. The school notifications provide critical information, such as who holds educational rights, and also serve as records requests. This is one of the procedures that we have implemented which has moved us into initial implementation of establishing ongoing collaboration to facilitate the expeditious transfer of educational records and information.  Our local FYSCP Executive Advisory Council has been reviewing local data to set program priorities. Our strategy is to provide increased support to districts with population concentrations, as well as to districts serving students who live in Short Term Residential Treatment programs. We continue to work toward gathering more academic outcome data in order to incorporate this information into our strategy as well.  In 2018-19 we collected data on program deliverables such as the number of Educational Progress Reports sent to social workers prior to court dates, the number of school notifications sent for detained youth, and the number of Child and Family Team meetings attended by educational representatives. We have been simultaneously reviewing dashboard and Dataquest data for every district in our county, while collecting local data in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our current services.|2019-10-03|Met|2019

SCOE staff is co-located at Solano Child Welfare Services (CWS) and acts as a liaison between the school districts and CWS to facilitate timely communication and transfer of records. SCOE staff also provides annual training for each district and community partners on the needs of foster youth and evidence-based interventions.   While SCOE has initiated a discussion among stakeholders about county wide priorities to support foster youth and the need for community wide assessments and program evaluation, there is considerable progress to be made in this area.
