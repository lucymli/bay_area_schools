The overall rating is based on the average score of eight categories inspected at each site and expressed as a percentage. The categories are: mechanical systems, interiors, cleanliness, electrical, restrooms/fountains, safety, structural, and exteriors. Multiple deficiencies may be identified in each category which affects the score for that section; categories with scores of 90% or higher are considered to be in ‘good repair”. Of the 136 (8x17) categories rated, 100 met the “good” or “exemplary” repair standard, 34 were “fair”, and 2 were “poor”. No extreme deficiencies were found during the inspections. The majority of fair and poor deficiencies noted were for conditions in the interiors, cleanliness and electrical categories. Facilities Services identified many of these deficiencies as wear and tear items to be corrected during summer cleaning and or as routine maintenance. A total of 1321 work orders were issued to correct the identified deficiencies.

Yearly, the head of maintenance and facilities, in conjunction with site and district administration, evaluate school site facilities using the Facilities Inspection Tool.

This includes assigning teachers appropriately based on their credential or subject matter competency. Cecil Avenue Math and Science Academy provides access to curriculum-aligned instructional materials for all certificated staff to use in their classrooms. Teachers are sent to various workshops to better understand the curriculum they are to teach. Last year, CAMSA provided teachers with Thinking Maps training to help students organize the information presented during class and to springboard into creating sentences and paragraphs. Recently, CAMSA brought in a trainer to train the staff on Thinking Maps Day 2 information. This second training included frame of reference and helping students understand the what and the why of a passage or activity. Cecil Avenue Math and Science Academy prioritizes safety/security. Policies and procedures are in place to ensure a safe/secure educational and working environment at all times. Last year, the District implemented the following safety/security initiatives: two-way locks for all classrooms; the Raptor Visitor Management System; hand-held radios for all office staff and instructional staff; additional staffing for supervising campus entry and exit points; remodeling of several office areas and entry areas to control access and improve monitoring; and additional security camera systems.|2019

The District’s Digital Learning Initiative (DLI) - which provided Chromebooks to all 9th, 10th graders in 2018-19 and has accelerated implementation to include all four grade levels in 2019-20 - has greatly supported the provision of standards-aligned materials to students.  Our identified area of growth in Priority 1 continues to be appropriately assigned teachers, as the District’s goal is a 0% misassignment rate in regard to teachers of English Learners, total teacher misassignments, and vacant teacher positions.  It is important to note that the rate of misassigned teachers reflects a dramatic improvement over the last four year.  The misassignment rate for the 2015-16 school year was 7%; this year’s misassignment rate of 0.4% reflects a 6.6% reduction in the rate of misassignments.|2019

We did have a higher number of teacher vacancies than usual last year due to a few teachers turning over in the middle of the school year and difficulty replacing those positions with qualified teachers mid year. But we have now filled all of those vacancies and currently have no staffing/teacher vacancies. Almost all of our standards based curriculum is now web based and students can access it from school or at home. For those students without computers at home, most curriculum can still be accessed by their smartphones. We have made a lot of progress on school facilities over the last two years.

Although the building is old, the school and church have worked together this year to upgrade fix the electrical wiring, replace water fountains, AC units, install new locks, resurface the roof, refresh old walls with new paint, renovate flooring in the majority of the classrooms, as well as installing new cameras to improve safety around the school. This has taken the number of items on the SARC in “fair” condition down to 7 and eliminated any "poor" as of the 2018-19 SARC.

Moreover, for multiple years now, 100% of local schools have earned overall ratings of “good” or “exemplary” repair, according to the Facility Inspection Tool. Such progress has gone beyond mere compliance and actually modernized learning environments to help prepare students for 21st century careers. Every campus now has WiFi access throughout, and more than 65,000 Chromebook tablets are being used in classrooms, enhancing the core curriculum and addressing the unique needs of unduplicated pupils and other learners. In addition, roughly half of campuses now have tablet devices, such as iPads, for every student. This year, as about 24,000 older tablets are phased out of daily use, they have been refurbished and distributed to families for home use, thereby supporting students beyond the school day.|2019

As part of compliance with the Sufficiency of Instructional Materials under the William’s settlement, Principals verified that each student had access to the Board-approved materials in the core areas, and the public hearing and resolution were completed at the October 7th, 2019 Board meeting. The Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) is used each year to generate reports also documented as part of the SARCs. All six schools are in the Good Repair status overall; however, five schools have areas that are below Good in a subcategory. El Portal, Jordan and Meadow Green received a rating of Fair for the External category; Jordan also received a Poor rating for Structural. Macy received a Fair rating for Structural and a Poor rating for External; Rancho also received a Poor rating for Structural. The External category includes playgrounds and school grounds along with doors, fences, windows, and gates. The Structural category includes structural damage and roofs. A Fair rating means the average fell within 75-89.99% while a Poor rating is between 0-74.99%. Most findings are related to rotted wood paneling on exteriors and/or roof issues.

The site principal has met with those teachers to remind them of proper food storage. Morris Elementary received three fair ratings for outdoor fountains that need replacement however the quality is still rated as healthy, roof concerns in 4 classrooms (portables that are not used for regular classroom instruction) and aging play structures.  Progress has been made with the safety of the playground structures with the installation of safety materials in the fall zones. McKinleyville Middle School received three fair ratings for window coverings, roofing needs in two portable classrooms and for our grass fields that have dangerous gopher holes.

15636510000000|McKittrick Elementary|1|0%|100%|0|2019-10-10|Met|McKittrick Elementary School’s staff and administration extended the California Instructional Materials adoption schedule.  The state adoption cycle for the core instructional materials is as follows:  Math in 2015, ELA in 2016, History in 2017 and Science in 2018.  McKittrick has added a year between each of the adoptions.  McKittrick adopted Math in 2015, ELA in 2017, and History in 2019.  Science will be in 2021.  The district has offered two years of systematic in-service during the implementation of each of the new core curriculum.  This approach negatively impacted the CAASPP Test scores in ELA in the short run, because the students were still using the old ELA Curriculum during the 2016-17 school year.  In theory it will do the same for History and Science.   These losses in ELA were highest in 2016-17 when only 41.82% of our students Met or Exceeded standards in ELA. This was down from 43% in 2015-16.  The additional time and in-services brought the scores up to 60% Met or Exceeded in ELA for 2017-18 school year, followed by a 10% increase during the 2018-19 school year.  This last year, the Math and ELA scores were both 70% Met or Exceeded.    Giving the staff time to digest the new curriculum before introducing the next subject has worked well for both students and staff.

It is important to note that the total teacher misassignments for 2018-2019 were primarily due to teachers who have a full credential, but were teaching outside their subject area as permitted by Ed Code, or were teaching on a Provisional Internship Permit or Short Term Staff Permit while they pursue their teaching credentials; each is board-approved at a regular meeting. Importantly, the number of total teacher misassignments decreased in 2018-2019 by 50% from 2017-2018.  Facilities repairs identified in the 2018-2019 report were made in summer 2019. The district continues to address deficiencies as they are identified on an ongoing basis; repairs identified since the 2018-2019 report will be reflected in the 2019-2020 report.

Annually, the district audits the placement of teachers to ensure that they are appropriately placed according to their credentialing.  The district also works closely with all teachers to ensure that they remain appropriately credentialed from year to year.   There has been an increase in the number and/or percent of teachers hired each year that reflect the overall student demographics. In 2018-19, the District used four strands for recruiting and retaining highly qualified teachers with the intent of increasing the number of underrepresented minority teachers who represent student demographics of the district.  The first strand included more focused recruitment strategies; inclusion of site representatives (administrators and teachers) in recruitment fairs; development of recruitment materials; and on-site interviews by site administrators (Stanford and SCU).  In addition, in the 2017 - 2018 school year, the District opened a subsidized infant / toddler care for teachers at a district school site and will be expanding subsidized childcare to teachers at at least one other site during the 2019 - 2020 school year.  Access to curriculum-aligned instructional materials and safe, clean and functional school facilities were assured through successful completion of the Williams Act, which found all six of the District's high schools to be in compliance.|2019

The assignments in question are special education teacher assignments; Preschool for All Learners (PALS) program and Special Day Program-Specific Learning Disability (SLD) program. For the respective program, the teacher has the appropriate credential. The reason for the discrepancy is the School Based Assignment Monitoring Report does not align to our special education program- Welligent. Welligent shows the services for all special education students and the name of the provider who provides the services. All Preschool students receive 2 hours weekly of speech and language services. These services are provided by a credentialed/licensed Speech and Language Pathologist. Therefore, if a student has a SLI eligibility, the student will receive services from a licensed/credential speech and language provider, not the classroom teacher.

Major and noticeable improvements to our facilities have been made including roofing, electrical, plumbing, and exterior paint. Middle School fields and landscaping at all school sites were improved. Technology infrastructure was significantly improved to support the implementation of the 1:1 iPad program and 21st Century Learning.|2019

In order to ensure that all students learn at maximum levels, teachers are required to have their CLAD credential and are assigned to teach courses according to their credential. Support in those courses includes standards-based instructional materials available for students in the classroom and at home. Each student attends school in a clean and safe learning environment that has annual formal inspections of over 1,460 areas. All school sites received 100% for the inspection areas because they are in good repair. These inspections were used to complete the SARC. In order to receive such high scores on the annual inspections, school personnel continually inspect and maintain their school site to a high standard of excellence.|2019

The District has reduced this number significantly since 2009 when approximately 400 teachers were identified as being "misassigned."  The single teacher missagnment and the single vacant teacher position are the outcomes of one situation.  In the fall of 2018 a junior high had an unfilled position for a Special Education class and a long term sub was hired to fill the position.  The school worked with the person filling the position to help secure the appropriate credentialing which, after multiple attempts, could not be done.  The substitute was eventually replaced by an appropriately credentialed teacher.  There were no Williams Act Complaints during the 2018 - 19 school year.  The School Facilities Conditions Evaluation for the 2018-19 school year scored 5 items as below "Good."   All 5 items, which are listed below, were addressed and corrected. *** 3 restrooms were too dirty, had missing lights, or needed paint *** 1 drinking fountain was too dirty *** 1 outdoor athletic field showed excessive wear|2019
