36675870000000|Adelanto Elementary|2|The LEA has purchased Illuminate test bank to support the district’s work with assessments and monitoring of student progress. Teachers from every grade meet annually to develop grade-level Common Formative Assessments (CFAs) in ELA and Math to be conducted each quarter and are conducted across the district within an established testing window for consistency and validity of test results. The questions in Illuminate are all aligned to the State standards and the results are evaluated to track progress in achieving proficiency in the standards. Prior to selecting the CFA questions each grade level has also worked collaboratively to develop standards alignment document and pacing guides for ELA and math. The CFA’s are aligned to these pacing guides for each quarter and allow teachers to track student progression towards achieving the standards. The CFAs are conducted to provide students practice with the testing format while at the same time assisting teachers to adjust their teaching to support student achievement of the standards and therefore plan their lessons and interventions accordingly. Principals meet with teachers three times a year, after the CFA’s have been completed, to review the data and support collaboration around adjustments needed both with lesson design and assessments. Through this process the district has ensured that all teachers in ELA and math are implementing the state standards. And GSS and social studies standards are also being implemented through constant professional development with the county to support teacher understanding of the standards. Piloting of standards aligned science texts have also supported with the implementation of the standards. Middle schools have continued to implement social studies framework shifts in their lessons and with support from DBQ supplemental materials. 1. Students in grades 3-8 also participate in the spring ICAs which are conducted similarly as the CAASPP tests. All teachers are trained on universal screening and designated supports prior to conducting the ICAs, and the data is used to view student progress and preparation for the main test.  2.

19647330118588|Alain Leroy Locke College Preparatory Academy|2|The school offers a standards aligned curriculum to ensure students are provided with rigorous grade level content in all core classes. Curriculum Directors and Curriculum Specialists developed the ELA, Math, Science and History “Course at a Glance” materials and curriculum maps that are aligned to CA Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards. All materials are available to all teachers via Green Dot's online platform. Additional curricular resources available online include model unit plans, lesson plans and summative assessments. ELA and Math intervention courses (Literacy Intervention, Math Foundation and Academic English Essentials) are offered at all grade levels to ensure students below grade level received targeted supports to meet their needs and work towards mastery on state assessments. English Learners also receive specialized support through ELD courses, based on their English proficiency levels, as well as through their designated supports in literacy intervention. Teachers receive 2 professional development sessions per week and coaching from content-specific curriculum specialists as needed. Professional development has been provided to all teachers on the Common Core literacy standards as well as their content specific standards. Green Dot utilizes the train-the-trainer model providing instructional leadership team members in each content area ongoing support in curriculum development and instructional strategies through department meetings and collaboration. Green Dot uses the Reading Inventory and iReady assessments to measure the literacy and math gains of each student. Students take both assessments three times per year for progress monitoring. For the 2018-2019 school year, 58% of students met their Growth Goal in Reading Inventory; 47% of students met their Growth Goal in iReady. In addition to these nationally normed assessments, Green Dot interim assessments are aligned to both Common Core content standards and Literacy standards to expose students to rigorous assessments and provide teachers with data to inform instruction and re-teaching as needed. In recent state assessment data for 2018-2019, 21% of students met or exceeded the standard in ELA. In order to continue to push growth the school will continue to focus on school-wide literacy strategies and the use of data to respond to student needs. In recent state assessment data for 2018-2019, 4% of students met or exceeded the standard in Math.

01611190000000|Alameda Unified|2|Local Indicators for Priority 2 To determine progress in implementing the academic standards, Alameda Unified School Districts (AUSD) tracks English Language Arts (ELA) and Math SBAC performance, Science CAST results, CTE pathway completion of graduating seniors, the percentage of English Learners accessing the Common Core State Standards in a setting with English-Only peers, and the Physical Fitness Test.  In 2018-19 AUSD’s overall percentage of students who met or exceeded ELA standards was 69%. This was above the county average (57%), and  up 1 percentage point from the previous year. The district’s overall performance has improved incrementally over the past three years (66% to 69%). In 2018-2019 there was significant improvement for proficiency at grade 5 (64% to 68%) and grade 11 (69% to 76%) compared to the previous year. At the K-5 level the district is in the 3rd year of implementing new CCSS-aligned curriculum. At the 6-12 level the district is engaging staff to further align curricula across sites.  In 2018-19, our overall proficiency for the district remained flat at 60% compared to the previous year and is up 2 percentage points over three years. The district is continuing implementation of recently adopted CCSS-aligned curriculum K-12 and are implementing planned changes to secondary math pathways to maximize appropriate placement/flexibility of students.   AUSD looks forward to reviewing its results form the 2019 California Science Test (at the time of Local Indicator submission they have not yet been released) to a baseline from which to track its progress in the coming years. The Next Generatoin Science standards are supported in AUSD via implementation of aligned curriculum (FOSS) in grades K-8. Science faculty in grades 9-12 are currently engaged in a discussion about course pathways, alignment, and curriculum adoption. In 2019-2020 the district will be piloting the new high school curriculum.  In 2018-19 the district exceeded the target goal of 12% by .2%. AUSD has implemented new pathways that will not be ready to offer a “Completer” (or second-level course) until SY 2020-21. This will impact our completion data for SY 2019-20. However, AUSD expects to achieve significantly higher completion rates in subsequent years.  In the 2018-19 school year, 98% of non-newcomer ELs accessed the Common Core State Standards in a setting with English-only peers. The remaining 2% is likely due to English Leaner students who are in Moderate and Severe Special Education courses. We will investigate our system of monitoring of these remaining students’ access to the Common Core Standards next year to continuously improve in this area.  Most students (63%) in AUSD pass the Physical Fitness Test in 5th, 7th, or 9th grade. We will be working to increase this percentage, and it should be noted that our rate is well above the County average.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-17||Met|2019

Both ELD and NGSS increased by one level from the year prior.  Increases within those two areas are due to targeted professional development and added ELD Instructional Specialists.   In providing appropriate instructional materials in the classrooms, the survey indicated that the following areas were at Full Implementation:  ELA and Math.  ELD, NGSS, and History Social Science rated at Initial Implementation.  History Social Science increased from Beginning Development to Initial Implementation.  Besides NGSS and ELD, a focus has shifted to Social Science, too.   In identifying staff instructional needs, the survey remained the same as last year, indicating Full Implementation in ELA and Math and Initial Implementation in ELD, NGSS, and Social Science.   In regards to the LEA’s progress toward implementing standards in other content areas, the survey indicated Full Implementation in CTE and PE, increasing one level from the previous year.  Health, VAPA, and World Languages remained at Initial Implementation.   In addition, the LEA was at Full Implementation in identifying the professional learning needs of all staff.

We are in the process for thinking about how to best refine our history curriculum. We currently use a combination of History Alive and the DBQ Project to provide students with the core content outlined in the History-Social Science Framework for California and key skills from the Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects outlined in the Common Core.   We are working to increase the number of enrichment and elective courses our students have access to.

These assessments along with analysis of student work provides evidence of student growth, patterns of learning, and areas of need in regard to standards attainment.   In addition, the district utilizes the Butte County Office of Education/California State Standards Implementation Metric for English Language Arts, Mathematics, English Language Development, Science, and Social Studies (conducted in Fall 2019) in order to gauge progress on the implementation metrics using the 5 point scale ranging from Initial Awareness to Full Implementation.  Staff at each site, and as a district group, self-reflect utilizing the grid as their guide and determine next steps and resources needed which are supported by district staff as part of our “Leading from the Middle” model of Leadership.   An added layer of analysis comes in the form of district walkthroughs which provide insight into current implementation levels and affirm next steps. Furthermore, staff at each site complete sections of a "Learning by Doing" Collaboration Survey in which teachers reflect on standards implementation and use of standards to drive instruction.  We have chosen these tools to ensure our district is making decisions based on information gathered from staff first-hand and that our analysis reflects actual implementation in classrooms. After gathering data, we have identified implementation of English Language Arts, English Language Development, and Math as between the developing and full awareness stages (Steps 2 and 3 of a 5 step rubric).  Social Studies, Science and Health Education have been documented at the initial awareness level (Stage 1) as we focus on implementation of new textbooks and integrating new standards.    All students receive Physical Education provided by single subject teachers and scores indicate increasing levels of performance on the physical fitness test (PFT).

24656310000000|Atwater Elementary|2|Atwater Elementary School District (AESD) is an elementary school district serving grades Transitional Kindergarten through grade 8.  All grades 3-8 participate in the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress and grades 5 and 7 participate in the California Science Test.  Grade 5 also participates in the statewide Physical Fitness Test.  In addition to these statewide measures, our district has many local indicators to track progress toward academic standards.  For English/Language Arts and English Language Development, the district administers 3 benchmarks yearly that include a question and answer section, a performance task, and a writing assessment.  Student lexile data is tracked through the Developmental Reading Assessment in grades Kindergarten and 1 and the Reading Inventory tracks students in grades 2 through 8.  For mathematics, district benchmarks are administered 3 times yearly and additionally the Math Inventory is administered in grades 5 through 8 to track intervention needs.  In the 2019-20 school year, AESD has also implemented frequent progress monitoring of standards through district-wide formative assessments.  This formative assessment data is tracked through our Professional Learning Communities for enrichment and re-teaching needs. The addition of Physical Education teachers has allowed the district to more closely monitor and track the implementation of physical fitness standards and required minutes.  STEAM camps and more recently a STEAM summer school have served to provide multiple opportunities in grade levels 1 through 8 to address NGSS standards.  NGSS is also supported through the funding of site level STEAM to implement units specifically in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics.  Assessments for these units are project based.  Teachers are also participating in coordinated NGSS professional development to ensure teacher collaboration and the learning and sharing of best practice. Visual and Performing Arts are offered through site level participation in our VAPA program in partnership with Merced Playhouse, which brings the visual and performing arts to each campus for a start to finish theater experience.  Student wellness and engagement is tracked through the California Healthy Kids Survey administered every other year and yearly through an online district survey.  The tools for standard tracking identified above were chosen for their alignment with state standards, ability to accurately progress monitor students, and alignment with district LCAP goals.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-08||Met|2019

The district begins significant curricular and instructional changes with the adoption of state approved instructional materials and professional learning around standards and frameworks. A multi-year roll out of curriculum and professional learning occurs on an 8-year cycle. In the implementation of state academic standards, AUSD utilizes evidence-based practices in teacher learning, such as coaching, collaborative learning communities, and ongoing job-embedded application- for example, the lesson study process. AUSD is deeply committed to a culture of ongoing learning and improvement. Therefore, the professional learning, collaboration, and support initiated as the district rolls out new standards and frameworks continues through the multi-year professional learning plan supporting continuous improvement of instruction. This ongoing cycle serves to ensure that all shifts identified in California’s adopted academic standards are being instituted and sustained in an authentic manner. An ongoing professional learning initiative for all teachers at all levels continues to focus on collaborative practices, cognitive rigor, and academic discourse. AUSD is entering into its 4th year of implementing district-wide professional learning around this initiative.

Bay Tech has adopted new core materials to fully implement all state standards as they have been introduced, but a need still exists to support teachers with the professional development that allows them to utilize new and existing print and digital curriculum to meet the needs of the students. Due to the wide variety of entering student levels, the school has recently increased the amount of adaptive and customizable web-based learning programs like i-Ready, IXL Math, U-World SAT Prep, and NoRedInk. Diagnostic and leveled programs are used to gauge student progress and make program adjustments. The goals of the 2019-2020 LCAP address the student gaps in learning and additional classes and programs needed to eliminate those gaps, individual teacher professional development needs, additional classes to be added to support college and career readiness, parent/student needs and school-wide professional development to support the structure of the program.

The instructional minutes tool was selected to ensure that the appropriate amount of allocated time is scheduled for content area instruction. The instructional rounds classroom observation tool was selected because the information gathered from the tool is directly connected to how standards are being implemented in daily instruction and highlights instructional practices supporting the implementation of State academic standards. The annual professional development survey was selected to ensure that the district is making decisions for providing professional development opportunities based on teachers' reported needs with implementation of State academic standards and District initiatives. One hundred percent of Elementary teachers submitted instructional minutes to the Curriculum and Instruction department referencing allocated time for content area subjects. Based on the instructional rounds classroom observation tool data, implementation of State standards represented by instructional practices in lesson design and student actions decreased; however, use of technology has increased. Site principals have access to this data in a site-specific format which reveals the level to which the State standard instructional practices in lesson design and student actions are implemented within classrooms. The annual professional development survey is used by District staff to inform professional development offerings to support staff in refining instructional practices. During the 2018 - 2019 school year; data revealed that staff is most interested in professional development focused on implementation of NGSS.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-03||Met|2019

54105460135459|Blue Oak Academy|2|Blue Oak Academy uses local (formative) and state (summative) assessments to measure our organizations progress in implementing the state academic standards adopted by the State Board of Education.  Teachers use assessment data from multiple sources as outlined in the BOA charter. We assess students by analyzing authentic student work, including projects, portfolios, presentations, and Lucy Caulkins reading and writing assessments with rubrics. In addition, we implement the national standardized assessment tool with NWEA Map testing twice a year, leading up to the CAASP testing in the spring. Common formative assessment will be designed during the 19-20 school year in order to provide teachers with both formative and summative assessment data for instructional decision making. A Whole School Report Card also compiles the data into one place that is presented three times a year to the school board. These tools were chosen to measure student growth of the state's academic standards as well as other areas. Teachers are held accountable through evaluations and walkthroughs focusing on lesson plans and schedules. They received professional development targeting implementation of research based instructional strategies aligned to grade level standards. Our instructional coach has also provided individualized guidance and support with teachers as they seek to help students access the curriculum.   Project based learning is used to implement the ELA and Math common core state standards throughout the units of study.  Some units also incorporate Next Generation Science Standards and History-Social Science standards.  Students receive a designated science block of instruction which targets the NGSS standards.  A future focus will be the learning and awareness of the English Language Development standards and the priority of designated ELD instruction for our English Language Learners.  Health Education and Physical Education content standards are taught through our PE programs.  All students receive Spanish instruction therefore World Language is implemented throughout our instructional program in addition to the option to participate in Visual and Performing Arts.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-09-19||Met|2019

The goal of all professional development is to provide research based strategies and programs that will build the capacity of our entire staff, and ultimately have a positive impact on learning and school culture. In recent years staff has been heavily involved in Universal Design for Learning (UDL), with opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of the guidelines with both professional development, peer observations and discussions, and team activities that identify strategies and create resources for their peers. Peer observations have occurred across the grade spans and subject areas as well as within grade levels. Teachers participate in weekly PLC meetings where the focus is on student achievement based on relevant data. Monthly professional development takes place on campus that is focused on current curriculum as well as pilot curriculum that will improve programs at Ackerman Charter. Currently, all staff is involved in piloting NGSS curriculum to select the best option for our students. In 2018-19, ACSD received a MTSS grant, while working with staff,  the greatest need identified was the area involving socio-emotional development.

56105610121756|BRIDGES Charter|2|Bridges Charter School implements all state standards adopted by the State Board of Education in ELA, ELD, Mathematics, NGSS, History-Social Science, Health Education, Physical Education, and Visual and Performing Arts. In promoting College and Career Readiness, our school has also adopted 21st Century Learning standards and has integrated College and Career Readiness into our Middle School homeroom curriculum. In Middle School, we offer Conversational Spanish as an elective, though we do not currently have a World Language Program or a Career Technical Education program. In order to assess student learning and our school's progress in implementing the academic standards adopted by the State Board of Education, we have adopted a new Mapping Assessment system (NWEA) for students in grades 2-8 which measures student growth in literacy and math. These assessments are adaptive, aligned with CAASPP, and provide us with authentic insight into student learning. These growth assessment allow us to identify trends in student performance overall and by subgroups, and they allow us to shift practices to address gaps and overlaps in curriculum and instruction. Our teaching faculty regularly collaborates on student work and common assessment data, and they discuss curriculum alignment. The assessments also align with state content standards. Teachers at Bridges also submit and analyze curriculum maps each trimester that demonstrate Common Core and NGSS alignment. With curriculum maps as an artifact, our teachers engage in regular dialogue about student achievement in math, reading, and writing in order to calibrate student achievement data and refine instructional practices. Our curriculum adoption is done in cycles and developed on dedicated teacher curriculum committees. In the 2017/2018 school year, we fully implemented NGSS school wide. In the 2018/2019 school year, we focused on monitoring the implementation of our Science curriculum aligned with NGSS, and we continued to monitor the implementation of our Reading and Writing curriculum and assessments. In 2019/2020, our Project Based Learning Committee is dedicated to ensuring that each classroom executes two Gold Standard PBL units. Further, in the 2018/2019 school year we began intensively investigating our Math curriculum and instructional practices on a teacher led committee; teachers began implementing Number Talks/Math Talks, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), Math Journals, and Counting Collections. In 2019-2020, we are investing more resources in training teachers in math instruction. Further, in support of meeting state standards, all curriculum is assessed at least quarterly and reviewed by teachers with administrative support.|5|3|4|5|4|5|3|4|5|4|4|3|5|5|3|3|4|4|5|4|5|5|4|2019-10-14|As we direct resources and attention in cycles, areas of curriculum development and teacher support in alignment with state standards are in different stages of development. After recognizing that our Math textbook adoption was not meeting the needs of our students, we formed a math committee in 2018-2019 to investigate new curricular approaches. Therefore, our progress toward meeting math standards and supporting teachers in math instruction is more developed than other content areas. While we have focused on full implementation of NGSS in 2017-2018, in 2019-2020, we are focusing on enhancing instruction by refining units to become Gold Standard Project Based Learning units. We therefore are sustaining NGSS through enhanced implementation of Project Based Learning units. Next school year we intend to invest more resources in revisiting our ELA curriculum and more fully integrating ELD standards into our classrooms. Therefore, the area of ELD integration is in Initial Implementation stages, and in some areas the ELA is in Full Implementation stage rather than Full Implementation with Sustainability.|Met|2019

We continue our process of piloting the middle school curriculum aligned to the  Next Generation Science Standards.  The NGSS pilot committee is currently exploring OER and adoption simulations as part of a district built curriculum in lieu of the adopted materials that were piloted.  Continual evaluation of curriculum and standards-based professional learning is being offered in mathematics. Cajon Valley Union School District has made it a priority to identify teacher needs based on an annual staff survey. Staff engagement is measured through our yearly Gallup Staff Survey.   This data is triangulated with parent and student surveys administered through Gallup.  Through the implementation of the Great Learning Opportunities (GLO) program, teachers are provided collaboration time to improve student outcomes.  Staff members use the standardized practice of Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) to set goals and track instructional effectiveness while students are provided with high-quality instruction in a broad range of educational programs from certificated teachers. Professional learning is also personalized and based on teacher choice through digital badging and conferences (summer, winter, spring).|Met|2019

Dr. Montessori believed that the role of an adult in a child’s education is to provide an appropriate environment, complete with tools and methods, to facilitate the child’s own discovery of knowledge and skills at the time when it has the most impact for their self individually. This system has a foundation based on trust and respect of the individual, and a belief that children will soar beyond traditional expectations.  CMP offers an environment which has the tools, programs, resources, and support to enable students to become educated to high academic standards, and to develop themselves to their full capacity as competent, happy, productive individuals, family members, employers/employees, and contributors to a better society and a peaceful world. This is achieved through a strong commitment from the parents, teachers, school leaders, community groups, legislators and, most importantly, the individual child.   CMP holds that an educated person is well-rounded and balanced. The CMP student shall become a collaborative member of a community, motivated to set and achieve high goals.  CMP encourages students to demonstrate empathy towards others through respectful and productive communications.

Canyon Charter School is at full implementation of the English Language Arts (ELA), English Language Development (ELD) and mathematics standards.  Canyon Charter students are successfully obtaining strong academic skills in English Language Arts (ELA) as evidenced by 94% of 3rd-5th grade students meeting or exceeding standards in English Language Arts (ELA). This year all student groups in English Language Arts maintained a status level of "very high" with 112.6 points above standard. This is an increase of 23.4 points from the previous year.  2nd grade students demonstrated proficiency in early literacy as evidenced in by 91% of 2nd grade students meeting early literacy benchmarks.  Canyon Charter has fully implemented new mathematics instructional materials across all grade levels since the 2014-15 school year, and professional learning on these materials included face-to-face training and online modules.  Based on the California Dashboard & Equity report, all students performed 95.6 points above standard.  This is an increase of 16.7 points from the previous year.  In June 2018, LA Unified adopted a new English Learner and Standard English Learner Master Plan. Mandatory professional development district-wide this year on the new Master Plan will support the implementation of the ELD standards Canyon Charter has supported the implementation of the ELD standards with tools such as sample lessons, observation forms, and an English Learner Dashboard (an online tool that provides real-time data on English Learner progress).  Canyon Charter is at initial implementation of the Next Generation Science standards (NGSS).  Since the state adoption of the NGSS in 2013, Canyon Charter has provided professional development on the NGSS and the instructional shifts necessary for classroom implementation. Canyon Charter is at full implementation and sustainability with the health education, physical education, and visual and performing arts.  Schools have been utilizing the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA) interim assessment blocks aligned to ELA and mathematics since Fall 2015. The school uses these data to identify supports and resources that schools may need during the school year to promote optimal student achievement.  Ongoing professional development and training are essential to the competence and overall effectiveness of all teachers and support personnel. At Canyon we dedicate the time and resources necessary to implementing an effective professional development schedule, which will have the most positive impact on the achievement of our students.

In non-core content, we believe the instructional materials should reflect and support the differing developmental and academic demands of each content area and materials are selected with that in mind.   Our professional development cycles are centered around our assessment cycle. Throughout the school year, teachers with the guidance of their content coach and other instructional leaders, engage in a robust series of focused, collaborative meetings. The cycle begins with analyzing assessment data (K-2: STEP and 3-8: Interim Assessments) in order to develop instructional goals for individual students, grade-levels, and grade-bands. Next, teachers and coaches collaborate to plan robust lessons driven by the data.

30664720000000|Centralia Elementary|2|CESD has identified local agency measures to track progress in implementing the state academic standards adopted by the State Board of Education. Through the implementation of research-based Common Core State Standards curricular programs and high-quality professional development, we have aligned student learning to state-adopted standards. CESD’s state testing scores indicate that, districtwide, the Distance From Standard showed growth of  +4 in ELA and +3 in Math. The District met our outcome through using a Multi-Tiered System of Supports that has supported our schools in developing a strong foundation for our students, staff, and parents. This framework implementation has allowed CESD to implement signature practices, that has yielded strong results. Some notable signature practices include: Balanced Literacy, Inquiry-Based Learning, Project-Based Learning, Thinking Maps, and Number Talks. CESD fully implemented the ELA/ELD Literacy standards with the support of pacing guides and the instructional delivery of our standards-based comprehensive program adoption. Additionally, the district implemented effective instruction of math standards through pacing guides to ensure thorough coverage of the standards, along with assessments that allow time for reteaching of skills and concepts. Our progress in implementing the academic standards of English Language Arts, English Language Development and Mathematics is at full implementation. Our teachers have been exposed to the standards through district-wide high-quality professional development, curricular materials, assessments, and scaffolds to provide instruction, differentiation, and enrichment.  Teachers have also participated in school site trainings and are bridging practice with their understanding of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The new framework of History-Social Science is in the exploration and research phase. Our implementation of Physical Education content standards is fully developed through a Physical Education Program grant partnership with America on Track, a community-based group. This partnership includes professional development, research-based curricular materials, sports equipment, and during the day instructional supports with PE Specialist supporting teachers at sites to create/deliver dynamic lessons for students to love physical activity.  We annually inform our governing board, stakeholders, and the public of our data and progress through regularly scheduled meetings. All measures relate back to student learning.

More effective learning takes place when students can relate new information to past experiences, their community, and their culture. The staff embraced the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards soon after their release. The staff has developed multiple projects over the past several years that address the standards and encourage students to think critically and problem solve. Staff has also been required to develop annual SMART goals that demonstrate their implementation of the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards. Through Professional Learning Communities and other professional development opportunities, staff have had time to examine in depth the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards. CSMH has aligned teaching methodologies, instructional materials and assessments to the state content standards.|Met|2019
37683383730959|Charter School of San Diego|2|CSSD annually measures its progress in implementing the state adopted academic standards through (1) curriculum alignment (percent of courses aligned), (2) quantity and quality of professional learning, and (3) evaluation of instructional programs.    (1) Curriculum Alignment: 100% of core courses are aligned to Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in English Language Arts (ELA), Mathematics, and History-Social Science. 100% of core Science courses are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). CSSD has aligned 100% of Health Education, Physical Education, and World Language courses. 74% of Career Technical Education courses are aligned to the CTE Framework. 70% of core courses are aligned to California English Language Development (ELD) standards. The school’s curriculum development plan includes specific timelines for each new core course to be aligned to ELD standards and each CTE course to be aligned to CTE Frameworks.    (2) The school measures the quantity (number of hours) and quality (evaluation of high relevancy) of professional development. Currently, teachers at the school exceed the professional development participation target of 60 hours. 95% of teachers report high levels of relevancy of the professional development trainings they attend.   (3) The school measures its progress in implementing programs to support staff in identifying areas where they can improve in delivering instruction aligned to academic standards. Instructional Leaders provide informal and formal supports to instructional staff on a weekly, monthly and annual basis. Through Resource Center Observations, staff are given actionable feedback on the delivery of instruction in ELA, ELD, Math, NGSS, and History-Social Science. Formal observations are incorporated into each teacher’s annual Scorecard (evaluation) review.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-31||Met|2019

04614246113773|Chico Country Day|2|Chico Country Day School used Butte County Office of Education’s CA Standards Implementation Metric for measuring the implementation of the ELA and Math state standards each year for the past three years. The school used teacher survey results related to Next Generation Science Standards as a baseline for measuring implementation of these standards. In addition, we measure and track the standards that are being addressed with project work through project planning documentation. We chose these tools to ensure the school is making decisions based on reflection from teachers about their implementation in the classroom and project work that is representative of the standards. After gathering the data, the majority of the staff have identified (3) full awareness of the ELA standards. Evidence includes collaboration between grade levels and resource teachers in developing benchmark goals in reading and writing, project planning work with vertical teams, and success criteria being coordinated over the grades. A new ELA curriculum was adopted and is in the first year of implementation. The teachers have identified that they are evenly split on (2) developing awareness and (3) full awareness for the Math standards. Teachers are using formative and summative assessments to monitor students and all teachers are moving students to engage in mathematical practices (creating models, using precision, communicating their understanding.)   The additional state standards implementation were not measured by this metric yet.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-09||Met|2019

45104540111674|Chrysalis Charter|2|According to the LCFF, “Charter schools must address the priorities in Education Code section 52060(d) that apply to the grade levels served, or the nature of the program operated, by the charter school.” This local indicator (measuring our progress implementing state academic standards) does not apply to the nature of our program.  Throughout the curriculum section of our charter is found phrases like “Therefore, our curriculum is open-ended and unpredictably varied from year to year. In order to develop competent, self-motivated life-long learners, the students’ learning will be a blend of teacher-directed and student-directed learning.” and “If students are to become competent, self-motivated, life-long learners, they must be given the opportunity to practice self-motivated learning. Their enthusiasms and interests must be empowered to alter the course of learning that happens in the classroom. This is a characteristic of Chrysalis. Students are supported in self-directing their learning.” The fact that our Smarter Balanced test scores are among the highest of all the elementary and middle schools in Shasta County, especially when compared to schools with a similar percentage of low income students, demonstrates that a standards-based approach is not the only model for successful education as measured by the standards-based metric. Fortunately, the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards are well aligned with a central tenant of our educational philosophy – to teach for understanding. While the nature of our program allows us the flexibility to not implement the state standards, we feel that our emphasis on student-directed learning and teaching for understanding closely aligns with the current state standards and would be reflected in standardized state test scores, iReady test scores, and other local assessment measures.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-09||Met|2019

Based on the results of the initial assessment, an individual learning plan is developed to provide the most appropriate course assignments in all academic areas, meeting all California Standards for each subject area.  If a student scores below their current grade level, a Student Success Plan is developed to address any gaps in all academic areas.  The Success Plan then becomes an intervention tool to help remediate the student closer towards grade level.  At the end of the year, all students are assessed in the same areas, in order to document all academic growth that occurred over the past year.  Based on internal data analysis and comparison of the scores, there is a positive correlation between the length of time at COIL and grade-level mastery.  The data suggest that it takes a minimum of two years for a student to remediate back up to grade-level mastery once they have fallen two or more grade levels below.  The data also suggests that if remediation is implemented within the first year of the student falling behind, it can take only one year or less to bring the student back to grade-level mastery.  COIL teachers and staff work proactively to identify and remediate student gaps as soon as possible.  COIL continues to focus on this area since it can strongly influence the true success identified on the Dashboard.|Met|2019

These assessments are administered in math and literacy at three points throughout the year. These assessments include both multiple choice and performance task responses to align to SBAC testing formats. They are scored and analyzed by the entire staff in order to inform instructional choices across disciplines.   - In addition, students must pass a portfolio defense performance assessment at the end of 10th and 12th grade. This process requires our students to analyze and synthesize their knowledge and growth across disciplines and standards.  These presentations are evaluated based on rubrics created in collaboration with Stanford’s Center for Assessment and Learning to meet the Common Core Standards. We use a variety of programs to intervene for students who are below grade level, such as ReadingPlus to support ELLs, IEP students, and students reading below grade level.

42691610000000|Cold Spring Elementary|2|Cold Spring School District is the highest performing school district in the State of California in both ELA and Math (CAASPP, 2018-2019).  The District has implemented Renaissance Learning Star Reading and Star Math. The high summative test results are attributed to the focused instruction provided by our teachers and the use of formative assessment data to monitor and adjust instruction on a daily basis. The formative assessment data is used to motivate student learning. The Superintendent/Principal regularly monitors student progress to ensure that all students achieve their quarterly benchmark goals. The school community is committed to a systematic approach to teaching and learning. In 2019-2020, the District developed and implemented a comprehensive Professional Learning Plan. The Plan was focused on supporting teachers with the academic standards adopted by the State Board of Education. The following highlights the progress in each subject matter:  Science: The District is in its third year implementing Amplify Science to support the NGSS. Research based instructional strategies have been implemented for effective science instruction and student learning. Mathematics: The District is focused on integrating mathematics into all core subject areas. All TK-6th grade classroom teachers work closely with the Music teacher, Visual Arts teacher and the STEAM teacher to create project-based learning experiences aligned to math skills taught in the regular classroom. English Language Arts: The District remains committed to an effective reading and writing program. A partnership with Literacy Partners provides the support for training teachers in the Lucy Calkins Writing Workshop model, a Columbia University Project. Social Studies: The District addresses the CA History-Social Science Content Standards through nonfiction text, literature, and community connections. These opportunities are provided through guest speakers and field trip excursions. Physical Education and Health: A robust Physical Education and Health program prepares children to be physically and mentally active. The sixth-grade teacher partners with UC Santa Barbara’s Gevirtz Graduate School of Education, to increase student’s understanding of mental health disorders, reduce the associated stigma, and share wellness practices. A community partnership with the Fighting Back organization provides student and parent awareness of the harmful effects of vaping.  Visual Arts: The goal of the Visual Arts program is that every child achieves a sense of confidence and enthusiasm that comes from being creative. Like the other Media Arts Programs, the Visual Arts program is fully integrated into the core curriculum in the regular classroom. Performing Music: The music curriculum is designed to teach music literacy and music appreciation through vocal and instrumental training. The program utilizes Dalcroze movement strategies, Orff technique, and Kodaly solfege reading and singing.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-14||Met|2019

42691790000000|College Elementary|2|The LEA uses an internally developed self assessment tool to measure the implementation of the CA State Academic Standards (CASS).  The survey is taken by each teacher in a facilitated focus group environment.  This setting allows the teachers to ask clarifying questions of the facilitator and each other.  The self assessment tool asks questions about the number of students taught, how many have the most current CASS aligned curriculum, and what percentage of instruction in the various content areas is rigorously aligned to the most recently adopted CASS.  The LEA chose this particular tool because it focuses on the implementation of standards in the instructional process and gives the district one number to simply and effectively measure annual progress.  In addition this tool was developed before the CDE's self-reflection tools and thus provides annual growth going back three academic years.  The 2017-18 and 2018-19 average response to the question, "Of the daily instruction your students receive from you, what percentage is rigorously aligned to the current CASS in your content area." was respectively, 93% and 86%.  The 2017-18 and 2018-19 average response to the same question, but for ELD instruction only was 90% and 90%, respectively.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-06-11||Met|2019

The number of students accessing Edgenuity varies by site.   BCOE school staff designed courses of study that allow standards alignment and flexible/ personalized learning to meet individual student need based on self-interest. ELA and math courses of study are final and implementation is occurring at the school sites with training support from LEA staff and school staff involved in the development.  Science and History courses of study are being developed and piloted in 2019-2020. Because BCOE school programs serve high-risk students, staff have been invested in professional learning to support student behavior and social emotional needs.  Due to the small number of staff, focus on these needs has taken precedence over academic professional learning in recent years.   The LEA rolled out and expanded a Student Centered Coaching model to better support staff with collaboration and hands on classroom behavior, social emotional and academic support.  The LEA developed a push in professional development model intended to reach more staff more consistently while keeping staff on site.  For the past two years, the LEA has worked to build capacity with leadership teams by sending them to offsite professional development and conference sessions. Data is collected on all models of LEA professional learning support and is used, in part, to drive decision-making.|Met|2019

36679590124032|Competitive Edge Charter Academy (CECA)|2|The Competitive Edge Charter Academy staff has worked diligently to meld the common core state standards with the International Baccalaureate program expectations.  Surveys, observations, anecdotal data, and committee data were all used as tools to determine progress towards implementing state standards.  Using a multitude of tools was integral to painting a deeper picture of where our LEA stands in this very important area.  The data collected was tabulated and the results were shared with the Competitive Edge Charter Academy School Board on October 22.  The data collected showed that in the area of implementing state standards for both English Language Arts and Mathematics 50% of the staff felt that we were in the full implementation to full implementation and sustainability range.  The majority of the remainder of staff felt that CECA was in the initial implementation range.  These results demonstrated the sea change that is taking place at CECA in certain grade levels.  State test results indicated a lack of growth in certain grade levels despite changes made in exposing students to practice assessments, which guided instruction, a new approach to teaching math based on empirical data, a new wave of thinking map training to support teachers in the teaching of reading and writing, contextual unit development training, etc. Reflecting on the state test results with these changes in mind, we determined the implementation of the standards must be an area of growth; therefore, it was expected to see these results for many staff members.    The majority of teachers also felt that CECA was in the initial implementation phase of implementing the adopted state standards in the areas of Next Generation Science Standards and standards in the area of History-Social Science.  Both of these areas of study have received attention over the past two years at the district level.  Teachers have participated in professional development, lesson study and unit creation.  The payoff has been evident in both formal and informal observations and in the amount of material being developed by the teams in both areas.    In the areas of ELD, Career Technical Education, Health Content Standards, Physical Education Model Content Standards, Visual and Performing Arts, and World Language the majority of CECA teachers feel we are in the full implementation to full implementation and sustainability range.  These results are not surprising because CECA is an International Baccalaureate World School.  Students receive instruction in a second language in grades K-8, they receive art and STEM instruction in grades K-8, physical education in grades k-8 (teachers are supported in teaching the PE standards by the PE instructor), and our counselor visits classes annually to support student sin learning more about how they can be college and career ready.   The results in this area will truly guide the staff development plans and collaboration topics going forward.|3|4|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|4|4|5|5|5|3|3|3|2019-10-22||Met|2019

A variety of resources were developed in these areas in order to enhance the district adopted curriculum. We also developed systems for teachers to evaluate and continue improving their practice in these areas. Some of these practices included collaboration time, walkthroughs, and lesson study sessions. In the area of science, during the summer of 2018-19 we provided an introductory NGSS training to K-12 teachers. They received an overview of the new standards and how to navigate them. This school year, we began a three-year partnership with UCLA Center X Science Project (NGSS). Teachers are working with the UCLA Science Project Team to develop their knowledge and strategies to deliver high quality science instruction that promotes the vision of NGSS.  In the area of History Social Science, we worked with the UCLA History and Geography Project. Teachers developed unit plans for the entire school year. CTE, World Language, and Physical Education Standards were fully implemented at all sites, although performing arts standards still need a stronger focus. Finally, although we have systems in place to identify the professional development needs of teachers, we are still strategizing ways to provide the necessary training and support on specific standards that they have not yet mastered.

CTE standards are an area of focus as new pathways are introduced. Physical Fitness standards, with independent study students in mind, have also recently been reviewed by instructional staff.  Continued attention to New Generation Science Standards and CAST content directs teachers’ course syllabi, learning period meetings, use of appropriate resources, and college/career readiness planning. Updated information is regularly shared with staff. When teachers need support with any subject standards mastery, leadership partners them with members who can help. CORE’s staff is highly collaborative in this way. Leadership maintains an “open door”  as well as actively seeks to  identify professional learning needs. Teachers are encouraged to continually participate in professional learning opportunities provided by CORE Charter School and other professional development networks.  CORE Charter School's ELD Coordinator 1) closely tracks EL learners, files progress reports,  and assessment scores, and communicates these findings to both teachers and parents throughout the year, 2) attends conferences to better understand and inform staff regarding EL standards aligned to ELA academic standards, 3) educates and models best instructional practices. At CORE all credentialed teachers are certified to meet students’ personal English development needs. With the addition of ELPAC, the ELD Program at CORE is in its Initial Implementation (3) stage.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-10||Met|2019

The self assessment tool asks questions about the number of students taught, how many have the most current CASS aligned curriculum, and what percentage of instruction in the various content areas is rigorously aligned to the most recently adopted CASS.  The LEA chose this particular tool because it focuses on the implementation of standards in the instructional process and gives the district one number to simply and effectively measure annual progress.  In addition this tool was developed before the CDE's self-reflection tools and thus provides annual growth going back three academic years.

As a new site, we hesitate to rate ourselves as sustainable in these areas, though systems are in place to ensure that they are sustained, we do not yet have a history that documents their sustainability. Da Vinci RISE implements a comprehensive common core aligned curriculum with 1:1, 24/7 technology access to the curriculum. We have a focus on personalized learning plans (PLP) and quarterly student monitoring to ensure success, progress, and appropriateness of curriculum. 100% of our 2018-19 instructional curriculum maps included corresponding subject area CCSS and ELD standards and Frameworks for Instructional Design. In 2018-19 100% of students had access to all programs and services with consideration of student need and interests. The school provides 21 days of professional development time per year on-site in order to develop their curriculum and projects, and teachers collaboratively plan curriculum to ensure Common Core Standards are being met on a weekly basis. All teachers also have weekly individual coaching meetings with site administrators that include observations, reflections on practice and implementation of standards, and personalized professional development goals and supports.|Met|2019

Identify the locally selected measures or tools that the LEA is using to track its progress: We have selected Northwest Evaluation Association’s (NWEA) Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) for measuring growth of English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics State Standards. Additionally, we review curriculum-embedded assessments to inform daily teaching and learning in both curricular areas.   2. Description of why we chose these measures or tools: We have chosen MAP because it personalizes each formative assessment by adapting test questions to each student’s learning level. As a result, the MAP scores help the LEA understand every student’s current achievement level and plan instruction and academic support accordingly. As an LEA, reports are created and analyzed (district, school, grade, class, and individual student levels). We administer MAP three times annually (Fall, Winter and Spring). We monitor and analyze data after each MAP and curriculum-embedded assessment through ongoing Cycles of Inquiry with school administrators and teachers.    3. Summary of Progress: ELA - After gathering multiple measures of academic performance data from the site, the teachers and principal agree there are many factors influencing very low student performance. With a developing awareness of the California (CA) ELA standards, shifts in teaching pedagogy, and a newly adopted curriculum, various professional development opportunities are needed. As a result, the district hired a Director of Educational Services to support and monitor both Curriculum and Instruction and provide support and resources in order for successful Assessment and Accountability reporting.  Math: After gathering multiple measures of academic performance data from the site, the teachers and principal agree there are many factors influencing very low student performance.  With a developing awareness of the CA Math standards, there is a need for increased understanding of the CA Math standards, academic rigor, and teaching mathematics processes, proficiencies and pedagogy. Professional development is an ongoing need in the areas of developing explicit learning targets and a Gradual Release Model (GRM) of implementation involving high levels of student engagement. As a result, the district hired a Director of Educational Services to support and monitor Curriculum and Instruction as well as Assessment and Accountability reporting.  In order to focus district priorities and resources, three district-wide goals have been created for current and subsequent years:  Goal 1:  Implement a Standards-Based Core Curriculum, including                Reading and Math Interventions, for low performing students.  Goal 2:  Involve all stakeholders in strengthening learning environments                that are effective, engaging and safe.

19647330115253|Discovery Charter Preparatory #2|2|The LEA has opted to use results from multiple diagnostic tests including; I-Ready, Achieve 3000, and Illuminate as well as teacher generated assessments based on their pacing plans, skillbinders and lesson plans in order to measure and track its progress in implementing the state academic standards adopted by the California State Board of Education.  The LEA decided that using a variety of measures including teacher generated assessments and pre-built assessments would provide the most holistic view of the LEA’s implementation and students mastery of the state academic standards.    Teaching is based on the Common Core State Standards. All teachers carry out curriculum based on the University of California A-G requirements. In addition, students have the opportunity to participate in dual enrollment classes at the community college level. Teachers are aware of students’ backgrounds and connect curriculum to community based issues. Teachers use formal and informal assessments to gauge student learning needs to inform instruction. Teachers replaced NWEA with Illuminate. Illuminate not only provides pre-built CAASPP quarterly assessments, but teachers can also create quizzes and tests in all core subjects:mathematics, science, english, social sciences. Illuminate provides a variety of data which allows teachers to conduct ongoing  assessments and view detailed reports, showing whether or not students meet academic standards.The Illuminate tests are a more effective method for teacher evaluation. Preliminary testing using the Illuminate Pre-Built tests show promising signs. The first round of testing presented poor results; however, after analyzing and disaggregating the strengths and weaknesses between each individual standard, students showed a marked improvement over the next round of tests. Further analysis and monitoring is ongoing to help teachers be better aligned with the CCSS.|5|4|5|5|5|5|4|5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5|1|5|5|5|5|5|5|5|2019-10-08|Every teacher attends summer orientation/professional development as well as monthly professional development workshops designed to meet the needs of our teachers. The LEA provides a multitude of opportunities for faculty, staff, and administrators to receive standards-based professional development training and attend off-site training programs that include: conferences, courses, and workshops. Additionally a total of 8 non-instructional days are allocated for professional development annually.       The school uses a one-day per week model of afternoon trainings for the entire faculty and staff. These weekly professional development meetings provide compensated meeting times for all staff to update their content-area knowledge, analyze and evaluate student performance, plan instructional units and investigate new strategies for implementing a standards-based curriculum for all students.       In addition to this, the LEA employs expert consultants to expand our staff’s knowledge of research-based strategies. The consultants use student achievement data, teacher needs assessments, and a strong research base to design their professional development program. The consultants also work one-on-one with teachers, providing individualized coaching and support regarding the standards and their implementation.|Met|2019

Ducor’s efforts to implement new state standards started in 2014 with professional development in the Common Core standards in English/Language Arts, Mathematics, and English Language Development. At the same time, we continued to support our full implementation of all other state adopted content and performance standards. Through our continuous improvement efforts, we continue to make significant investment in all aspects of implementation. Ducor conducts a rigorous annual evaluation of the implementation of state standards through survey of teachers, staff and parents. Administration monitors teacher lesson plans weekly and regularly observes classrooms in order to assure that all teachers are implementing the curriculum content and strategies. Emphasis has been placed on English Language Development and support for English learners to assure they have access to all aspects of the curriculum. Local evaluation includes the impact of multiple criteria including recruitment and retention of highly effective teachers, multi-level professional development geared to teacher and school professional development plans, standards-aligned core instructional materials, multi-dimensional supplementary materials for differentiation of instruction, remedial and intervention programs targeting specific student learning needs, schoolwide literacy programs and strategies (such as “designated” and “integrated” English language development and other schoolwide literacy approaches), timely intervention and remediation, regular examination of student work, and administrative support and monitoring. Results confirm that we have achieved “full implementation” in: English/Language Arts, English Language Development, Mathematics, Health, History/Social Science, Model Library Standards, and Physical Education. We also have fully implemented the previous state science standards and are continuing in the process of transitioning to the Next Generation Science Standards.

04614320000000|Durham Unified|2|The Durham Unified School District locally tracks implementation activities and progress. The process begins with standards and framework reviews; establishing an early implementer team for in depth framework study focusing on the selection and evaluation of materials; reviewing SBE approved programs; selecting and piloting programs; conducting comparison studies to inform program selection; involving stakeholders in program examinations; conducting/providing professional development; and identifying site leads to serve as implementation experts who can provide ongoing coaching support. Implementation monitoring is supported with administrative observations, evaluations, walk-throughs, and peer to peer observations. Monitoring of student and educator access to online resources is providing an additional level of monitoring. Successful implementation is evident in student achievement. There has been growth in relative standings to comparison groups which indicate strong initial implementations (see the LCAP annual report) at: http://www.durhamunified.org/documents/-18-19%20Draft%20LCAP%20June%2015%202018.pdf Implementations are supported with centralized PD, site based PD, and weekly collaboration meetings where course alike, as well as cross-curricular teachers can plan together. DUSD implementation status by curriculum areas is summarized below: Mathematics: Fully implemented and sustainable since Fall 2015 ELA/ELD: Adopted, initial implementation, fully implement Fall 2016, building internal capacity Social Science: Awareness, framework study stage, scheduled to fully implement Fall 2018 Science/NGSS: Awareness, instructional shifts, scheduled to fully implement Fall 2019 Career Technical Education: Agriculture and Manufacturing/Engineering have established pathways, with plans to expand to include Ag based science courses and industry certification in solid works.

41690620126722|East Palo Alto Academy|2|External consultants worked with our teachers to develop Common Core state standards pacing guides that are published on our website.  ELA Common Core standards based units and pacing guides have been developed and implemented across all four years of ELA.  Using the ELA Common Core language standards as a basis, all other departments engaged in the same work with our external consultants to publish CCSS pacing guides in Social Studies, Math and World Languages.  The Science department used the Next Generation Science Standards as the framework for the pacing guides in Physics, Biology and Chemistry.   For the 2019-2020 school year the Math program is benefitting from additional support through The Algebra Project, working with researchers and colleagues to reimagine Algebra and the “math mindset” approach to teaching Math, inspired by the work of Stanford professor Jo Boaler.  Additionally we have a teacher on special assignment working with Algebra and Physics for 9th grade, in collaboration with our after school support team.  With the EPAA tutoring center staffed by EPAA staff and Stanford volunteers, and the local Boys and Girls Club of the Peninsula, our colleagues are ensuring that all supports are maximized to support students in their Math and Science efforts.   Our ELD teacher worked closely with the English department  in developing lessons that align with the CCSS.  In addition, the District has hired EL Achieve to work with teachers on District-wide implementation of language acquisition strategies.  Twenty five percent of EPAA teachers have participated in the EL Achieve Constructing Meaning training; in addition, 3 of our teachers are in the EL Achieve Constructing Meaning leadership strand. To measure our progress towards the standards, teachers use standardized assessments such as the MDTP and GMRT to measure growth in Math and Reading.  Additionally teachers implement the Interim SBAC assessment and various standards-based formative and summative assessments.  As a culminating annual assessment all students must complete an inter disciplinary exhibition that includes standards in Math, English Language Arts, and Social Studies, called Exhibitions or Defense of Learning, which are a graduation requirement.|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|3|4|1|4|4|5|4|3|2019-10-16|In addition to the work being done by each subject area to implement standards aligned curriculum and assess the effectiveness of said curriculum, there has been work across disciplines to own and improve our students’ engagement in their learning. To this end all EPAA teachers came to school three days early in August 2019 to participate in the Buck Institute Project Based Learning 101 professional development institute.  Teachers are now deeply engaged in project based learning in all courses, with an eye on a defense of learning final assessment as a graduation requirement, connecting the projects and evidence of learning to our five habits: personal responsibility, social responsibility, critical and creative thinking, application of knowledge, communication.   Students are also required to connect to our Bulldog Way, which are social emotional learning tenets based on what we have learned about our students who are successful in college persistence.|Met|2019

34673146112254|Elk Grove Charter|2|Elk Grove Charter administers an annual State Standards Implementation Survey that asks its teachers to specify their familiarity, frequency of application, and level of implementation of each of the state standards that are relevant to their teacher assignments, along with other questions about instructional practices and professional learning preferences.  The primary measures of implementation are the district’s survey that asks teachers to rate their own implementation and the school’s implementation at one of five levels: exploration phase, beginning development, initial implementation, full implementation, and full implementation and sustainability. In addition, EGCS administers a local survey that is aligned to the state’s 5-point score self-reflection tool. EGCS monitors improvements over time and differences across subjects so that resources can be targeted to improve implementation where additional support may be needed. In addition, information about teacher familiarity with standards and frequency of implementation serves as formative data and may help identify facilitating factors or barriers to deeper implementation. EGCS response rates are low on the EGUSD administered annual survey. The data is incomplete for most subgroups and response numbers have been as low at 4 respondents. Knowing this, EGCS also administers a locally administered survey to teachers.  For the 2018-19 school year, on the school’s local survey (100% response rate), the percent of teachers who rated the school a four or a five on the scale was analyzed and presented. In the area of professional learning for teachers for recently adopted academic standards, 50% of ELA teachers; 57% of ELD and Math teachers, 36% of Science teachers, and 21% of History teachers indicated the school was either implementing or fully implementing and sustaining practice. In the area of the school’s progress in implementing policies or programs to support staff in the continuous improvement in delivering instruction aligned to standards, 35.7% of ELA teachers, 28.6% of ELD, Math, and History teachers, and 21.4% of Science teachers rated the school at levels 4 or 5.  In addition, the school’s success at engaging in the following activities was rated by teachers and administrators by the same 5-point scale. 42.9% felt the school identified the professional learning needs of the teachers and staff as a whole, 35.7% felt the school identified the professional needs of individual teachers, and 28.6% felt the school provided support for teachers on the standards they have not yet mastered.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-01||Met|2019
34673140000000|Elk Grove Unified|2|EGUSD administers an annual State Standards Implementation Survey which asks teachers to specify the extent to which they are familiar, how often they apply, and their overall current level of implementation of each of the state standards that are relevant to their teacher assignments, along with other questions about instructional practices and professional learning preferences.  These measures were chosen to monitor and improve implementation of the state standards.  The primary measure of implementation asks teachers to self-rate their own personal implementation as either Early Developing, Developing, Early Applying, or Applying. These response options represent a range of implementation where Early Developing means “considering or attempting to implement,” Developing means “partially implementing,” Early Applying means “mostly implementing,” and Applying represents “completely implementing.” The survey also asks teachers to rate their familiarity with state standards (not at all familiar, somewhat familiar, familiar, very familiar) and how often they use the state standards (never, sometimes, often (weekly), very often (daily)).  EGUSD monitors improvements over time and differences across schools and subjects so that resources can be targeted to improve implementation where additional support may be needed.  In addition, teacher familiarity and frequency of implementation information serves as formative data and may help identify facilitating factors or barriers to deeper implementation. This annual teacher survey has been administered each spring for the last four years.  In 2019, 1208 teachers responded, representing about 36% of teachers districtwide. In 2018, 869 teachers responded, representing 28% of teachers districtwide. In 2019, across all content standards, 67% indicated familiarity with state standards, up from 64% in 2018.  In addition, 73% indicated weekly or daily application, up from 68% in 2018.  The percentage teachers rating their implementation of state standards as Early Applying or Applying was 66% in 2019, up from 59% in 2018.  The remaining 34% of teachers rated their implementation of state standards as Early Developing or Developing.  By content area, the percentage of teachers rating their implementation of state standards as Early Applying or Applying was 90% for English Language Arts, 89% for Math, 65% for English Language Development, 47% for Science, 55% for History/Social Science, 57% for PE, 80% for Career Technical Education, 100% for Health, 75% for Model Library Standards, 92% for Visual and Performing Arts, 83% for World Languages, and 45% for Literacy.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-01||Met|2019

36677020000000|Etiwanda Elementary|2|To assess the level of implementation for the state standards in Grades Kindergarten – 8th, ESD administers a self-reflection tool based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) for teachers.  The self-reflection tool asks teachers to place themselves on a continuum of practice in the areas of subject matter and content standards knowledge, planning for a range of learners, instructional strategies and approaches, and use of assessment for instruction.  The Developmental Levels of the CSTP range from Level 1 Emerging, Level 2 Exploring, Level 3 Applying, Level 4 Integrating, and Level 5 Innovating.  Data collected from the survey in May 2019 indicates 93% of teachers rank their “knowledge of subject matter and academic content standards” as Level 3 Applying or higher, with the majority falling in Level 4 Integrating.  Data results also indicate approximately 94% of teachers rank their “understanding and organizing subject matter for student learning,” as Level 3 Applying or higher, with the majority falling in Level 4 Integrating.  Additionally, data indicates 93% of teachers rank “planning instruction that incorporates appropriate strategies to meet the learning needs of all students” as Level 3 Applying or higher, with the majority falling in Level 4 Integrating.  In the last area, 93% of teachers rank “collection and analysis of assessment data from a variety of sources to inform instruction” as Level 3 Applying or higher, with the majority falling in Level 4 Integrating.  The self-reflection tool indicates that the majority of ESD teachers are implementing the state standards in the areas of mathematics, language arts, English language development, science, social studies, and physical education in Kindergarten – Grade 8, at a successful developmental level.  The self-reflection tool also indicates that our newest teachers are still developing their teaching practice and the majority rank themselves as Level 1 Emerging and Level 2 Exploring for state standards implementation.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-24||Met|2019

41690620119503|Everest Public High|2|At Everest, we have designed our curriculum and student experience to align with common core and state standards. Summit Public Schools provides all schools in the Summit Public Schools network with a base curriculum. This curriculum includes Common Core aligned projects and content assessments that teachers collaboratively plan, edit, execute and provide feedback on. Through the planning process, teachers gain greater understanding of the Common Core and are able to guide students to proficiency more fluidly. The work that students do as part of the common assessment plan is more authentic to real world skills, enabling them to better meet Common Core proficiency. Teachers have set aside time to become familiar with the parts of the assessment plan, as well as time each week dedicated to improving the projects and content assessment for their students and building enrichment into the curriculum. Teachers also have dedicated days of professional development around assessment calibration, and long-term curriculum planning. As an organization and at each of our schools we use a variety of tools and measures to track progress on meeting and implementing the standards adopted by the State Board of Education that include both our standardized assessment program as well as our coaching and development program for faculty. Our Standardized Assessment Program is a schedule of externally validated assessments thoughtfully laid out and scheduled throughout the year that include pre-assessments, mid-year formative assessments, and summative post-assessments. These assessments are used as measures by the LEA of progress on the Common Core Standards because they provide evidence and feedback on a variety of topics especially literacy and numeracy. Assessments planned include the following (this list is not exhaustive): SBAC interim assessments (both the comprehensive assessment- ICAs and the block assessments- IABs); NWEA MAP a math and reading tests used for pre-assessment of 6th- 10th graders, mid-year assessment and end of the tear assessment and as part of English Language Development/Learner proficiency; PSATs; SATs and ACTs. Additionally, we use data and information from our coaching and induction programming to inform teacher performance in their adoption and implementation of standards. At Everest each teacher receives weekly coaching and has time for professional development every 6-8 weeks where coaches and coachees review lesson plans and student performance data and use identified look fors and standards aligned to best teaching practices for implementation of the curriculum. Beginning teachers at Everest are also involved in an induction program and are evaluated for their cleared credentialed based upon their ability to implement the standards.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-06-20||Met|2019
19647330129858|Everest Value|2|Everest Value School aims to become an innovator in delivering a demanding Common Core aligned education. This has been accomplished through a meticulous teacher development program, a rigorous curriculum, and investing in technology-rich classrooms.  Everest Value has purchased researched based core curricular resources to ensure that the CCSS are being addressed at a level of rigor necessary for students to be successful on the SBAC. The school uses the Lucy Calkins Readers and Writers Workshop, as well as the Journeys, and Collections anthologies to address Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts. HMH Go Math! Curriculum addressed the Common Core State Standards for Math. In addition, this year teachers attended a LACOE training on eight Mathematical principals of Common Core.  Everest currently uses the TCI Science and Social Science curriculum to address the Next Generation Science Standards and History – Social Science. This year, to enhance the Science TCI curriculum, Everest created a STEM Lab in the computer lab. It should be noted that the school views all curricular resources as “tools” to be used as situations arise in a data driven classroom. Under the guidance of mentors and with the help of supplemental sites, many of our teachers have developed much more creative and engaging lessons. Everest Value School utilizes the expertise of their veteran educators to guide teachers to maximize the potential of a school year. Everest has sought out mentors to lead a K-2nd grade, 3rd to 5th grade, and 6th to 8th grade teaching team called a “cluster”. Mentor teachers model exemplar instructional practices, reflect and debrief with teachers on their practice with action steps, and collaborate on operational and curricular matters with teachers.  Everest has shifted its development focus, from more formal periodic observations, to a weekly observation and more practical dialogue with mentors. This year to enhance this process, teachers participate in an ongoing Self-Study project that includes peer observations using Marshall and insight rubrics. Every Wednesday afternoon, teachers at Everest Value School participate in a professional development led by either the principal, a mentor teacher or an outside expert. This year the school has gathered resources from Insight Education and the Teach Like a Champion series.  Everest Value School regularly assesses student progress during the academic year. Teachers gain a comprehensive view of student progress through cross referencing data from the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA) system. This year the school has focused on using the “Quadrant report” to track growth and the “Student Profile Report” and the “Learning Continuum” for more specific individual student data. Moreover, EVS also uses SBAC Interim Cumulative Assessments and Interim Assessment Blocks to guide teachers to further estimations for student performance.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-25|The school uses the NWEA benchmark 3 times a year to ensure classrooms are rigorous and student learning is increasing above the national median growth percentile.

47702920000000|Forks of Salmon Elementary|2|Our one school District has a total of 9 students enrolled from Kindergarten through 7th grade. Currently most grade levels have a limited number of students (often only one pupil in a specific grade level) so curriculum ends up tailored to their skill level and exposure and understanding to curriculum. Because it is a one room school house, curriculum units are taught across the board with different activities and lessons for each grade level. Our credentialed teacher, paraprofessionals, or resource support from SCOE help support students. Teachers provide feedback and review curriculum annually with Administration and Board to help make sure we are meeting minimum standards adopted by the state.   In the fall of 2019, our credentialed teacher and Administrator will be meeting with SCOE for support and advice on current curriculum and future adoptions, after reviewing State Board of Education curriculum standards for each grade level as guide to what should be offered at certain grade & skill levels along with teachers classroom notes & lesson plans help determine if we are meeting academic standards adopted by the state for students in our Elementary School. District will review curriculum samples, compare what is being offered in other local schools when making final adoptions for curriculum updates.   Annually, within 8 weeks of the start of the school year, we have a meeting with Administrative staff, Credentialed Teacher, and Board Members to share with the stakeholders current curriculum adopted for each grade level and each subject. Quarterly throughout the school year teacher and administrative staff meet with Parent Group to discuss fundraising for enrichment programs which have often been funded in part by fundraising efforts by parents and the community to support students in a variety of Physical Education activities, World Language, and Visual and Performing Arts through out the school year which are selected based on the teachers recommendation to better support curriculum for students, and who is available to offer additional support at the school through out the year.   During the 2018-19 School year we had a new teacher who preferred use of computers in the classroom across all core subjects. Board has received parent feedback request curriculum be more hands on in future years. Upon hire of new teacher for 2019/20 this will be heavily considered in subjects where appropriate.|3|3|3|1|1|3|3|3|1|1|4|4|4|4|4|0|5|5|5|3|4|4|4|2019-10-28|During the 2018-19 school year we hired a teacher who had just graduated and supported him by paying for his participation in the Induction Program, providing substitute teachers so that he could meet with his mentor and tour other sites, and offered to pay a stipend for participation in additional professional growth and development that would help them become more highly qualified teachers.|Met|2019

It is to be expected some subject areas are further along in the implementation process due to the timing of various state adoptions.  Survey results indicate teachers generally feel supported in pursuing content standard related professional development and trainings. However, the results also indicate a desire by some to have professional development to be more strategically encouraged by administration and department chairs, particularly in the areas of science and social studies. The FUHSD LCAP includes several expected annual measurable outcomes related to the Priority 2. During the 2018/2019 school year 58% of District teachers participated in State Standards related professional development.

30664980000000|Fountain Valley Elementary|2|Fountain Valley School District has made extensive efforts in providing both site- and district-level collaborative time for teachers in order to implement the California Academic Standards.  Over the past five years, K-8 teachers have developed district-wide units of study in mathematics that include rigorous common assessments for all grade levels.  In Kinder through Grade 5, teachers administer formative reading assessments with all students at regularly-scheduled intervals over the course of the school year, analyze site-level and student-level data from those assessments, and provide targeted reading instruction for students.  In Grades 6-8, ELA teachers also administer formative reading assessments at regularly-scheduled intervals over the course of the year.  In addition, for grades 6-8, ELA teachers have developed common novel units of study and common assessments driven by the CA Standards.  K-8 science teams have been working collaboratively to implement the Next Generation Science Standards and will be engaged in the instructional materials adoption process over the course of the 2019-20 school year.  History/Social Studies teachers from grades 6-8 will also be engaged in the instructional materials adoption process during the 2019-20 school year.  Teaching teams supporting music, foreign language, and physical education will also be working collaboratively to ensure that instruction aligns with standards and will be engaged in ongoing professional development activities that support the congruence of instructional practices across all school sites.  In order to support English learners across FVSD, English Learner Coordinators from all ten school sites meet regularly to explore bridge and supplemental materials to accelerate the language acquisition process for students.  Administrators and EL Coordinators, as well as many classroom teachers, have attended training on the ELD standards and the accompanying EL Proficiency Assessments for California.  FVSD's review of results from the Initial and Summative ELPAC assessments further inform practices related to improving student achievement for English Learners.  Moreover, research-based strategies for supporting English Learners are embedded in all district-led professional development activities.  Fountain Valley School District monitors the implementation of Academic Standards in a variety of ways.  FVSD administrators and teachers engage in rigorous data analysis from various forms of summative and formative assessments for reading and math throughout the school year, and use the data to drive decisions about how best to support students.  In addition, Teachers on Special Assignment and content area experts within the education community provide ongoing support for teachers.  The California Standards serve as the backbone for all professional growth activities.  The high achievement of students on CAASPP assessments provide evidence of the strength of our academic program.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-10||Met|2019

The modification limited responses to three options from the five listed in the original tool: 1) Exploration and Research Phase, 2) Initial Implementation, and 3) Full Implementation. Overall, in the areas of ELA (100%), ELD (93%), and mathematics (97%), the survey results showed that staff believed that we are at the initial or full implementation stage for standards and framework, professional development, availability of of standards aligned materials in the classroom, and standards aligned co-learning opportunities. Administrators provided time for teachers to evaluate delivery of instruction aligned to the standards through professional learning communities, focused classroom walkthroughs, instructional, and grade level planning time.  Overall 77% of those surveyed believed that the District was implementing NGSS at initial or full implementation.That percentage was a slight increase from the prior year.  For standards aligned materials, 56% of survey participants in 2017-2018 believed we had the appropriate classroom materials compared to 80% in 2018-2019. Of those surveyed, 77% believed that time was being provided for growth in professional learning through learning strategies as compared to 68% in the prior year.  History-Social Science (HSS) was the one area that showed a slight increase in implementation of standards aligned professional development (from 12% to 20%), standards-aligned instructional materials (16% to 23%), and standards aligned co-learning (16% to 23%). The district chose to focus on ELA, ELD, mathematics, and science. Full Implementation of the updated HSS framework is set for 2020-2021 school year. Schools and teachers will be given time to implement the recently adopted programs. However, Grades 7 and 8 HSS teachers began to implement the new framework in 2017-2018 with the available materials.  As an elementary school district, the District focused on health education content standards, physical education standards and visual and performing arts standards. Health education, and especially nutrition, is delivered by our full-time physical education teachers to students in grades kindergarten to six. Seventh grade students receive health education in compliance with CHYA. Physical education standards are delivered by designated, subject-specific physical education teachers in grades kindergarten to eighth. Teachers met as a PLC at least three times a year to plan implementation of the health and PE standards. The visual and performing arts standards are delivered through visiting educator artists with the support of classroom teachers.

19645500000000|Garvey Elementary|2|Local Measure  Garvey School District developed a set of Standards Implementation Metrics for measuring the implementation of state academic standards. The metrics assess the extent of implementation, using a 5-level scale, in six domains critical to the effective standards implementation: knowledge of standards and framework, standards-aligned instructional materials, standards-aligned instruction, tiered supports and intervention, professional development, and data-driven practices. The five levels (developmental stages) in the metrics specify district-specific benchmarks for each level in each domain for each discipline.  Scale: 1 – Exploration & Research; 2 – Beginning Development; 3 – Initial Implementation; 4 – Full Implementation;  5 – Full Implementation & Sustainability  Rationale These metrics were developed to ensure district-specific benchmarks and initiatives are examined in the assessment process. Using this tool, instructional leaders, principals, and teacher leaders worked collaboratively to evaluate the level of implementation of the standards in each discipline, identifying specific evidence of progress, next steps, and growth targets.   District’s Progress The goal is to attain Level 4 (4 points) or above for each discipline. The annual growth targets include: 1) demonstrating an average increase (for standards at Levels 1-3), and 2) maintaining 4/5 points (for standards at Levels 4/5).  Using the 2017-18 data generated from the metrics as baseline, the following is a summary of the extent of standards implementation for each discipline for 2018-19.  ELA – 3.35 (Annual Growth: +0.2)          Math – 3.59 (Annual Growth: +0.76)   ELD – 2.96 (Annual Growth: +0.1)   Next Generation Science Standards – 2.95 (Annual Growth: +0.3)   History/Social Science – 2.6 (Annual Growth: +0.1)  Physical Education – 3.0 (Annual Growth: +0.1)  Visual and Performing Arts – 3.5 (Annual Growth: +0.8)  Summary of 2018-19 Annual Growth Average Increase (for standards at Levels 1-3): 0.34  For a detailed report on the Local Performance Indicators for 2018-2019, please refer to this link: https://www.garvey.k12.ca.us/apps/pages/about/lcap   Summary of 2018-19 Annual Growth Average Increase (for standards at Levels 1-3): 0.34 Status in Meeting the Local Performance Indicator for Priority 2: Met|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-17||Met|2019

As needed, we acquired new core and supplemental curricular/instructional materials, texts, software, etc. including materials for whole class instruction, tiered interventions, and targeted interventions  Our curricular review included implementation of standards in the following areas: • English Language Arts: Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts • English Language Development (Aligned to Common Core Standards for English Language Arts) • Mathematics: Common Core State Standards for Mathematics • Next Generation Science Standards • History-Social Science • Health Education Content Standards • Physical Education Model Content Standards • Visual and Performing Arts • World Language  Professional Development Related to Standards Additionally, teachers across several departments attended workshops and professional development in the community to become better acquainted with the new standards.  They also used paid planning time to update materials.  Analysis of Student Achievement In Relation to Standards In order to continue aligning curriculum and instructional practices with CCSS, our entire faculty as well as curriculum teams analyzed the results of Smarter Balanced Assessment tests as well as internal benchmarks in order to understand student learning and pinpoint areas to grow and find new materials.  Departmental professional development, as well as grade level teams, then used this information to plan new professional development and acquire appropriate course materials.  As a result of sustained effort and attention, we were able to update roughly 30% of our materials this year.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-16||Met|2019

19645680000000|Glendale Unified|2|The following measures were chosen for their alignment to the CCSS and their effectiveness in measuring content area mastery and 21st century skills required for success in college, career and beyond. GUSD uses CAASPP assessment results to measure ELA and Math mastery as the Claims intentionally identify areas of strength and growth in Reading, Writing, Listening, Research, Problem Solving and Modeling Analysis, Communicating Reasoning, and Mathematical Concepts and Procedures. CAASPP interims serve as formative assessments throughout the year.  GUSD uses the FitnessGram, a non-competitive health-related assessment that utilizes Healthy Fitness Zone® standards to measure student mastery of fitness levels based on the PE Standards. Data from the 2018-19 ELPAC serves as the most effective summative measure for assessing English learner progress. Once the data is available, the CAST will be used as the main science indicator because of its direct alignment to the CA NGSS.  Until then, the CSS for ELA & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects as measured through the CAASPP assessments serve as the best indicators of student achievement.  Dual Language Immersion teachers will be trained on the use of the ACTFL rubric to assess students’ language abilities. Site-specific assessments serve as the most conducive measure for assessing student mastery of VAPA standards across all disciplines of the arts. The CTE MCS guides assessment of student mastery in CTE courses. The CCSS as measured through the CAASPP assessments are currently the best indicator of student achievement with regard to the College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards. Comprehensive Health and Secondary Social Science do not participate in any district identified local measure beyond our content area contributions to student success on the CAASPP assessments.  2018-19 CAASPP results indicated increases in ELA performance in 3rd, 4th  and 7th grades and in Math performance in 3rd - 7th grades. Decreases in ELA performance were noted in 5th,  6th, 8th and 11th grades and in Math in 8th and 11th grade. Performance levels for ELA in 5th grade remained steady.  The 2018-19 ELPAC results indicate that 40% (2252/5619) students performed at a Level 4: Advanced Level in English language acquisition. Areas of strength from the California Physical Fitness Test are trunk extension and flexibility. Six courses were A-G approved for the 2017-18 school year, 26 courses were approved for 2018-19 school year and 44 courses were approved for the 2019-2020 school year. Increasing VAPA courses across levels support expansion of Arts pathways. Results of a district-created survey will provide direction and support to effectively utilize the ACTFL rubric for assessing student mastery of language acquisition. Social Science departments are currently working with organizations including The LACOE Center for History and Social Studies Education to further support.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-22|Acronym Legend ACTFL - American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language                                                                          CAASPP - California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress                                                                              CA NGSS - California Next Generation Science Standards                                                                                              CAST - California Science Test CCSS - Common Core State Standards CTE - Career and Technical Education ELA - English Language Arts ELD - English Language Development DELAC - District English Learner Advisory Committee ELAC - English Learner Advisory Committee ELPAC - English Language Proficiency Assessments for California LACOE - Los Angeles County Office of Education MCS - Model Curriculum Standards PBIS- Positive Behavior Intervention and Support PD - Professional Development PE - Physical Education PLC - Professional Learning Community PTA - Parent Teacher Association|Met|2019

54722560135863|Global Learning Charter|2|As described in our 2019-20 LCAP, GLC has identified 8 metrics to track its progress in implementing the state academic standards. Of the 8 indicators, 5 reflect locally selected measures. The LEA has made good progress implementing the academic standards based on these metrics. These measures are listed below. • Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System (BAS) o This measure is widely considered a reliable tool for determining students’ independent and instructional reading levels. The F&P BAS is implemented a minimum of 3 times per year for grades K-2. The BAS is implemented as appropriate for TK students.  • Renaissance Learning Star Reading assessment o This measure serves as both a screener and progress monitoring tool. Star Reading is a standards-based, computer-adaptive assessment that measures reading comprehension; monitors growth; and tracks understanding of focus skills. The Star Reading assessment is implemented a minimum of 3 times per year for grades 3-8. The Star Reading assessment may be implemented to students in grade 2, as appropriate. • Implementation of CA state content standards, as measured by professional development opportunities and curriculum planning o Ongoing professional development that addresses the CA state content standards supports teachers’ implementation of those standards. In 2018-19, staff development meetings focused on key initiatives related to the implementation of CA state content standards, including Writing, ELA/Literacy, Math, and Project-Based Learning (PBL). More specifically, staff development topics included, but were not limited to: Lucy Calkins Units of Study in Writing; Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI); and, online learning resources such as Newsela and Lexia/PowerUp. The development of curriculum maps and pacing calendars, aligned to the District’s priority standards and created by teachers, support the implementation of the CA state content standards. In addition, current attention to creating greater clarity in the area of standards, learning progressions, success criteria, and assessment support the implementation of the CA state content standards.  • Annual Parent Feedback Survey o This tool is administered annually and measures a number of important items that support school planning and development. Data show that parents gave GLC an average score between 4.1 and 4.5 (on a scale from 1-5, with 1 being “strongly disagree” and 5 being “strongly agree”) on various measures related to curriculum and instruction.  • Local Assessment Data o GLC administers several additional measures of student academic performance and growth, as part of a locally-developed and teacher-built balanced literacy program. Other local assessment tools include, but are not limited to: unit tests from the adopted Math text (Investigations and CMP 3), Star Math, Lucy Calkin’s Units of Writing prompts and rubrics, Lexia, and Newsela.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-29||Met|2019

Each year, the curricular maps are revisited and refined. While we have fully implemented the teaching of the state standards, it is challenging for our scholars to demonstrate what they know on the SBAC. This appears to be partially due to the computer administered assessments and the challenges of small screens and keyboarding skills on the available Chromebooks. Therefore, during the 2019-2020 school year, we will make greater use of the Interim Assessment Blocks (IABs) by integrating them into our instruction and administer the Interim Comprehensive Assessments (ICAs) toward the end of the first and second trimesters. It is hoped the greater use of these resources will reduce the technological and developmental challenges of the assessment format.  For our English learners, we are exploring refinements in our practices when it comes to our designated ELD time block. We are exploring instructional resources that make this leveled instruction more effective. Additionally, we will explore vertical grouping strategies to provide more targeted support for our English learners. Within the ELA instructional block, we will increase our mindfulness of the integrated ELD/ELA standards correlation.|Met|2019

19647331933746|Granada Hills Charter|2|GHC overall Graduation Rate is "Green" with a 93.6%; the overall Suspension Rate is "Green" with 0.4%; the overall College and Career Indicator is "Yellow" with a 63.6% prepared; Math overall achievement is "Green" with 7.2 points above standard; ELA overall achievement is "Green" with 63.1 points above standard. Though GHC has an overall student performance that indicates students are successful, there are areas that we have identified need significant improvement. All departments need to to implement common formative benchmarks which will measure student growth and incorporate areas of need identified in the Math and ELA claims. Time for Interdisciplinary planning and collaboration will be provided in order to monitor and reflect upon the implementation of universal instructional strategies that will target the focus areas identified on the CAASPP. Department alignment and vertical articulation is a focus. Determining measurable outcomes for each grade level or subject within the discipline and being transparent with the clear articulation will benefit all students in the proficiency and growth within the subject. School climate and a focus on the purpose of homework has been an identified area since 2017-18. Surveys given to students around homework and time spent on homework allowed the school leadership team in collaboration with school site committees to develop a homework goal which addresses how we measure academic performance and how homework impacts school climate.Based on local performance indicators GHC has identified student groups with identified areas of need of support both academically and behaviorally. Our African-American, English Learner, Students with Disabilities, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged and Hispanic student groups within the graduation rate indicator have been identified as struggling subgroups in local performance assessments as well as state indicators. Through our positive behavior intervention and Coordination of Services Team, we are addressing the suspension rate indicator where our foster youth, English Learner, African American and Students with Disabilities student groups demonstrate a targeted need. Additionally, through the implementation of two stakeholder surveys which captured fall as well as spring data in order to see growth within one academic year, there was still a need to focus on differentiation and personalization in instruction to ensure the success of students and improving the overall school climate. Steps to address these areas of need are aligned with our focused professional development which will continue to address Standards-Based Grading, Differentiation and the personalization of instruction. Refined common discipline specific benchmarks and the conversations with faculty to continually identify, through multiple internal and external data sources, the students with immediate need for our tiered intervention (academic and behavior) will continue to be key to seeing greater gains.|5|4|5|5|5|5|4|5|5|5|5|4|5|5|5|5|4|4|5|4|5|5|5|2019-10-07|GHC will fully implement state-adopted ELA/ELL and Math, Social Science, NGSS,  World Language, Health, Visual and Performing Arts, CTE content/skills and standards for all subgroups.  • EL Professional Development provided by experts in the field • School will seek to implement academic content standards for all core subjects as they are adopted by the state and provide focused professional development around differentiation.  • Teachers will participate in annual professional development on the implementation of the state standards.  • Universal instructional strategies will be identified and implemented in all disciplines which will target the identified “claims” for intervention in ELA and math. • Teachers will participate in a “Building Resilient Students” professional development • All teachers will hold the appropriate credential to teach in the program.|Met|2019

The 17/18 academic year was the 2nd year of a school-wide math adoption and considerable professional development hours were spent building and improving instructional practices in implementing the new adoption.  The 18/19 academic year GVCS implemented a school-wide write where all essays were scored on staff developed rubrics.  This was administered two times through out the year to monitor progress.  An added challenge to the 18/19 academic year was that GVCS had 7 new teachers.  New teacher support became a priority through regular coaching sessions from the school's instructional guide and Instructional Leadership Team.

Most areas showed growth over the 2018 data, while others held steady and only a few fell slightly. Some disparate responses are attributed to the subjects surveyed (e.g. CTE and World Languages) not being present at all grade levels and thus skewing the perceptions of teachers who are unaware of the increasing capacity of the high school in it Spanish department and in adding additional CTE pathways to the curriculum, most notably a Health Sciences pathway. GUSD made progress in last year’s goal of increasing professional development opportunities based on staff feedback in core areas. There is still a perceived area of improvement in availability of instructional materials in most areas, though science showed improvement.  Staff also reported growth in coaching and programs around science, with other areas holding flat. Non-core disciplines showed either steady reports or drops in perceptions of implementation.   The implications of these results are that faculty are largely comfortable with standards around ELA and ELD, felt growth in science, but would like to see more opportunities and materials in science, math, and social studies. Data further indicate a perception that the non-core disciplines receive less attention.|Met|2019

Tubman has adopted new core materials to fully implement all state standards as they have been introduced, but a need still exists to support teachers with the professional development that allows them to utilize new and existing print and digital curriculum to meet the needs of the students. Due to the wide variety of entering student levels, the school has recently increased the amount of adaptive and customizable web-based learning programs such as iReady. Diagnostic and leveled programs are used to gauge student progress and make program adjustments. The goals of the 2019-2020 LCAP address the student gaps in learning and additional classes and programs needed to eliminate those gaps, individual teacher professional development needs, additional classes to be added to support college and career readiness, parent/student needs and school-wide professional development to support the structure of the program. Recently, Tubman has adopted McGraw-Hill Inspire Science in grades 7th & 8th. Teacher professional development followed for proper implementation, but Tubman is in the first phase of full implementation of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).|Met|2019

01611920000000|Hayward Unified|2|In HUSD, we use state and local assessments as well as on-going formative assessments to measure student progress and guide instruction. Teachers work together during collaboration time in order to determine how they can best design instruction and provide student support, as needed.  We provide professional development at the site level primarily, with some district-wide offerings, in order to develop teachers' knowledge and skills.  We work with administrators on the use of multiple data sources to measure progress, guide interventions and offer professional development. Instructional Leadership Teams and School Site Councils work to make sure that schools are on track for providing students and staff what they need to be successful.  Our LCAP provides a structure for taking a close look at our data, setting goals, determining actions, and reflecting on progress.  Administrators provide guidance to staff on instructional focus areas and techniques. Teachers on special assessment also support teachers in their work. We provide training on how to unpack standards, claims and targets on the CAASPP in order to understand what students need to know and be able to do for college success.  HUSD is in the process of adopting CCSS Language Arts Materials for K-12th grades.  For the Elementary curriculum, HUSD made a decision to pilot 2 current Language Arts Curricula in both English and Spanish.  To facilitate this process in the spring of 2019, Hayward USD convened a steering committee of teachers to research and determine which 2 curricula would be piloted. In the fall of 2019, 60 Elementary teachers representing all grade levels and programs are piloting the Benchmark Advance/Adelante Program and the Fountas and Pinnell/Mondo programs.  After the pilot is complete, the steering committee will make a recommendation to the School Board to purchase selected materials for the 20-21 school year.  For the secondary level, an adoption committee will be convened in the Fall of 2019.  This committee will peruse all of the available Language Arts Materials for 7-12th grades.  The committee will narrow down the choices to 2 curricula that sites will interact with deeply.  The committee will meet in early 2020 to make a recommendation to the School Board for purchase for the 2020-21 school year.  In addition, a committee of English Language Development teachers for secondary will follow an adoption process to select a new ELD curriculum for the World House program at Tennyson High School and Chavez Middle School. In 2016, HUSD adopted CCSS aligned mathematics for grades K-12, in 2016. HUSD is aware that there is an urgent need for updated instructional materials for Science, Social Studies, World Language and Health.

BCOE school staff designed courses of study that allow standards alignment and flexible/ personalized learning to meet individual student need based on self-interest. ELA and math courses of study are final and implementation is occurring at the school sites with training support from LEA staff and school staff involved in the development.  Science and History courses of study are being developed and piloted in 2019-2020. Because BCOE school programs serve high-risk students, staff have been invested in professional learning to support student behavior and social emotional needs.  Due to the small number of staff, focus on these needs has taken precedence over academic professional learning in recent years.   The LEA rolled out and expanded a Student Centered Coaching model to better support staff with collaboration and hands on classroom behavior, social emotional and academic support.  The LEA developed a push in professional development model intended to reach more staff more consistently while keeping staff on site.

34765050108415|Heritage Peak Charter|2|Heritage Peak Charter School utilizes current educational research data in its implementation of suitable standards-aligned curricula and instructional programs for all students to best prepare them for college, career and life. We seek out and offer a variety of standards-based curricular supports.  Focus is given to core content for classes in math, language arts, science and social studies for grades 6 – 12.  We produce and maintain course descriptions and syllabi and administer end-of-course testing to ensure content mastery.  Our students participate in normed growth projection testing twice per school year, at the beginning of each semester.  The NWEA MAP testing gives our teachers and parents actionable data to determine student needs and subsequently address those needs with standards-based instruction.   The data from the NWEA MAP test is analyzed by staff to monitor growth of both grade-level groups and individual students through the use of focal groups and intervention rosters.  Student goals are set based on these findings, and individual plans are enacted using the Response to Intervention protocol. As a school offering individualized learning opportunities, HPCS ensures both adopted standards-based curriculum and a broad array of options for coursework support these standards.  Throughout the semester, the teacher and school leadership conduct progress monitoring using Exact Path, Study Island and/or other individualized programs. Teachers work to align instruction with Common Core standards using specified support materials and programs.  We are working to implement Common Core standards through new materials and learning activities from local resources. These integrate students with their communities in preparation toward good citizenship.  Some resources include concurrent community college enrollment, volunteer opportunities and service projects, homeschool co-operatives, library workshops and local parks and recreation agencies classes.  We offer access to supplemental coursework through online programs that are aligned to Common Core Standards such as Edmentum programs, Discovery Education, and Khan Academy.   All teachers hold California Teaching credentials and participate in ongoing professional development throughout the school year.  The staff meets monthly for professional development, and there are web-based modules designed to familiarize the teachers with various opportunities for the student, such as the Edmentum programs.   HPCS utilizes ICEV Online CTE Certification programs, and Medical Career classes (EKG Tech, Medical Assistant) to provide students the opportunity to explore career choices.

At the same time, we continued to support our full implementation of all other state adopted content and performance standards. Through our continuous improvement efforts, we continue to make significant investment in all aspects of implementation. Hope conducts a rigorous annual evaluation of the implementation of state standards through survey of teachers, staff and parents. Administration monitors teacher lesson plans weekly and regularly observes classrooms in order to assure that all teachers are implementing the curriculum content and strategies. Emphasis has been placed on English Language Development and support for English learners to assure they have access to all aspects of the curriculum in the broad course of study. Local practice and policy includes evaluation of the impact of multiple criteria including recruitment and retention of highly effective teachers, multi-level professional development geared to teachers and school professional development plans, standards-aligned core and supplemental instructional materials, multi-dimensional supplementary materials for differentiation of instruction, remedial and intervention programs targeting specific student learning needs, schoolwide literacy programs and strategies (such as “designated” and “integrated” English language development and writing across the curriculum), local benchmark testing to allow timely intervention and remediation, regular examination of student work, and administrative support and monitoring. Results confirm that over the past year, we have achieved “full implementation” or “full implementation and sustainability” in: English/Language Arts, English Language Development, and Mathematics, while also maintaining “full implementation” in Visual and Performing Arts, Health, and Physical Education, and History/Social Science.

01611920137646|Impact Academy of Arts & Technology|2|Impact Academy’s curriculum is driven by the academic competencies through our portfolio defense system: Analysis, Inquiry, Research, Creative Expression. The rigors of CCSS mean that Impact Academy has implemented a CCSS-aligned math curriculum 6-12 this year (Illustrative Math in grades 6-8, Algebra, Geometry, Algebra II; CPM for PreCalculus; AP for AP Calculus.)  Currently, Impact Academy is using teacher-designed CCSS-aligned curriculum in all non-math subjects grades 6-12. Impact Academy is in process to adopt CCSS-aligned curriculum for all subjects and support quality implementation.   At IA, as part of the Envision Schools Network, we use Common Interim Assessments to track progress in the implementation of Common Core Standards. These assessments are administered in math and literacy at three points throughout the year in grades 6-12. These assessments include both multiple choice and performance task responses to align to SBAC testing formats. They are scored and analyzed by the entire staff in order to inform instructional choices across disciplines. For grades 6-8 we administer the NWEA-MAP assessments in Reading and Math 3 times throughout the year. In grade 11, our ELA Common Interim Assessment now includes pieces from the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessment Blocks (IAB).  In addition, students must pass a portfolio defense performance assessment at the end of 8th, 10th and 12th grade. This process requires our students to analyze and synthesize their knowledge and growth across disciplines and standards. These presentations are evaluated based on rubrics created in collaboration with Stanford’s Center for Assessment and Learning to meet the Common Core Standards. We use a variety of programs to intervene for students who are below grade level, such as ReadingPlus, MyOn, IXL, and Khan Academy to support ELLs, IEP students, and students reading below grade level. Lastly, to engage students’ exploration of careers, students in grades 6-8 participate in field trips to local businesses, and our juniors and seniors complete a Work Learning Experience internship in a career path of their choice.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-11-14||Met|2019

37683380118083|Innovations Academy|2|Assessment: We continuously assess, reflect and make adjustments so that our students achieve academic success based on their individual needs. The best measure and support for any individual child is a formative assessment: observing, providing feedback with instruction and observing again. We do this ongoing throughout the year.  We assess our alignment through continuous teacher coaching, teacher collaboration and committee work. We begin the school year reviewing data from the previous year. Within the first month of school we also administer the Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) in K-8, and the NWEA Measure of Academic Progress (MAP) for grades 2-8. This data gives us a clear picture of how each student scores on assessments in reading, language arts and math. Though we firmly believe that children are much more than data points and that tests do not give complete academic data, we do believe that assessments can give us information that we can use to understand and support student learning. Both of these are well researched.  Summary of Our Progress: English Language Arts – (full implementation and sustainability of the CCSS within a writing and reading workshop model and inquiry based learning environment. Projects also incorporate both fiction and nonfiction reading and writing. Phonics instruction is solidly part of our program in primary grades.  English Language Development (initial implementation)  Mathematics – (full implementation of the CCSS) 90 daily minutes of math and incorporation of math standards in projects. Use of STMath in all classrooms. Next Generation Science Standards (full implementation) Our inquiry studies and projects align well and cover the NGSS.  History-Social Science: (full implementation) Our project/inquiry based program provides opportunities for all students to interact with history, geography, civics and other social science areas in meaningful ways connected to real world applications.  Health Education Content Standards (initial implementation) A medical doctor instructs students in grades 6-8 about sexual health as well as drug and alcohol use. Our science and social studies projects address nutrition and physical activity.  Our social emotional program deals extensively with social, emotional, personal, community and mental health.   Physical Education (full implementation): We have a full time coach who teaches the PE Model Content Standards to all grade levels. Visual and Performing Arts: (full implementation and sustainability) At Innovations Academy all of our students participate in classroom instruction in fine arts and performing arts. Additionally, our teachers incorporate art throughout the curriculum. World Language: (Full implementation and sustainability in middle school/research and exploration phase in the K-5 grades) At Innovations Academy our students receive standards based instruction in Spanish from 6th-8th grades.

These include project learning, inquiry based learning, problem solving, hands on activities, deep community connection and integration of subjects. All studies address the California academic standards.  Teachers are given the professional freedom and respect that they deserve.

All teachers use multi-modal, project based, and cross curricular strategies. Furthermore, standards are posted daily to ensure that teachers are validating every lesson is attached to a specific part of each standard.   In English, students are engaged with a variety of texts that focus primarily on critical reading and writing skills.  Annotations are a focus in ELA classes, and students conduct research projects, as well as cite textual evidence to support analysis.  Students work thoroughly with every aspect of the writing process, including planning, organizing, peer review, and revising.  Furthermore, students work with a supplemental program to further students English education and compliance with Common Core standards.  Additional supplementary programs are used to support English Language Development as well as frequent professional development in SDAIE strategies and tools to help all classes support English language development. Such supplemental activities include but aren’t limited to summer enhancement, and membean.   For mathematics, teachers use a McGraw Hill textbook that is based on common core standards.  Furthermore, an additional class and program are used to supplement math education at Ivy Bound. The program used is ALEKS and it assesses and self paces students based off their individual needs.The McGraw Hill is also used in the history class to ensure that common core standards are met by the social studies class. The science curriculum is based on Next Generation Science Standards.  In regards to Career Technical Education, Ivy Bound offers computers as an elective, and students work with google suite and excel.  Additional computers curriculum covers robotics, web design, and coding. The goal of this class is to provide them with tools to use and enhance in their future education and careers. The other elective that students take for four years is art, which provides students with a strong background in several mediums of visual art.  For Physical education, Ivy Bound uses a fully credentialed Physical Education teacher and requires that all standards are met.  Overall, every class at Ivy Bound is driven by common core standards, and every teacher is fully credentialed and trained.  Each class’ curriculum is dedicated to and aligned with common core standards.  Furthermore, NWEA assessments are used three times a year to collect data on students’ achievements.  The assessments are used to determine students’ progress towards goals and areas of difficulty.  Teachers and staff reflect on the NWEA data and adjust their curriculum to ensure that students are all meeting Ivy Bound expectations and common core standards.|4|4|4|4|5|5|5|5|5|5|4|4|4|4|4|5|4|5|5|1|4|5|5|2019-12-09|Ivy Bound provides many different methods of identifying needs of individual teachers and as a whole school. Some of the tools used are peer observations with reflection, principal classroom observations, end of year review with a goal for next year, self reflections, NWEA scores, CAASPP scores, and other supplemental materials. On top of those listed we provide students and parents with a survey of each teacher and as a school. There is always room for growth on how to improve our strategies of implementation.

Various data points can be disaggregated, which is one of the reasons DataZone was chosen.  Our leadership across the district reviews the academic data constantly and shares the data with their staff which allows each site to make informed decisions regarding teaching and learning.  Our District Office leaders review the academic data as well to determine the foci for our district as well as determining what professional learning is necessary for our staff.  JESD also uses Fastbridge, which is a Universal Screener.  Our students take this local assessment 3 times a year.  Because Fastbridge is an adaptive tool, our staff can determine how much growth a student is making in ELA and Math, and can then determine next steps.  Jefferson Elementary School District continues to make progress in building student capacity in all content areas.  The use of newly adopted ELA, Math, History and Science curricula is helping our teachers to teach current, culturally relevant curriculum.

In line with our mission to prepare all students for success in college and beyond, KIPP supports both Common Core State Standards (“CCSS”) in grades K-12 and ACT College and Career Readiness Standards (“CCRS”) in grades 9-12. The CCSS' represent the knowledge and skills that prepare students for college and careers. The CCRS standards and assessments provide a way to measure the knowledge and skills and are gateway assessments of whether students are ready to enter college. Together, these standards and assessments ensure that our students are ready to take on the rigors of college and future careers.

The school community takes pride in continuous improvement in academic excellence. In 2019, 82 percent of students met or exceeded standards in ELA, and 78 percent met or exceeded standards in mathematics. Each year, close to 75 percent of students graduate eligible to attend schools within the UC/CSU system and more than 50 percent have completed at least one college-level (Advanced Placement) course with a passing exam score. Furthermore, the number of students taking AP courses has increased by nearly 50 percent in the last five years while maintaining a 90 percent pass rate.   The California State Standards provide the foundation for meaningful classroom instruction, effective intervention strategies, and rigorous and relevant curriculum. Staff is supported through differentiated professional development and aligned instructional materials. Furthermore, LBUSD embraces the Professional Learning Community (PLC) philosophy, in which teachers and site leaders work collaboratively with the shared goal of improving student learning through a Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS). This personalized approach to supporting the standards and framework implementation is reflected in our annual LCAP survey where 83 percent of staff agreed that district and school leaders value professional development and 70 percent agreed that professional learning positively impacts their instructional practice.|Met|2019

Thus, strict adherence to state priorities is not viewed as critical; many families choose Lagunitas for that reason.   Over the last few year, progress has been made toward implementing those state standards that are seen as valuable to the school community- especially in fundamental subjects such as reading and math.  The school has been working toward a goal of ensuring grade level reading achievement for all students by 3rd grade and grade-level readiness for 8th graders as they matriculate into high school. The District has made progress toward the first goal and has been successful in achieving the second.  For the second year in a row it has seen over half of its graduates place above grade level when they get to high school and remainder place at grade level.  Placement in remedial high school math is all but unheard of in Lagunitas as of 2018.

The school offered both 9th-10th graders A-G aligned coursework as stated in the charter petition, and state required course work. The curricular foci were ELA, MATH, NGSS Science, and World History in grade 10. This was the school's first year implementing History curriculum and coursework for the 2018-19 school year. As a start-up charter school, the school leaders focused on building an academic culture and supporting teachers in fulfilling the model of the charter petition. The professional development focus was executing academic rigor. Our model for teacher development is based on depth and complexity, and mastery of professional learning standards. Additional elements to accelerate teaching and learning will be addressed through the professional development programs during the 2018-19 school year. New teachers are learning to unpack content standards, develop learning targets, and engage students at high levels in order to most effectively deliver academic content. The LEA selected high quality, standards-based aligned materials, and are supporting teachers in mastery of the materials. As the school expands each year to a 9-12 high school by school year 2020-21, the curricular areas will be fully developed in all of the areas encompassed in the dashboard.|Met|2019

01771800138289|Latitude 37.8 High|2|In alignment with State Priority 2, Latitude has developed Goal 1 of its LCAP to support the implementation of State Academic Standards. In this goal, Latitude seeks to provide an engaging, high-quality, rigorous, standards-aligned curriculum in a broad course of study that incorporates 21st century learning opportunities, including math, science, social studies, targeted English language development and language arts. To do so, the school will implement a rigorous whole child approach that not only meets the basic needs of students, but also takes into consideration their socio-emotional, academic and behavioral needs.  Latitude’s approach to teaching and learning is driven by the design principles of personalization, relevance, integration and creativity, which in turn become the four pillars of the Latitude student learning experience. In alignment with these four design principles, student learning at Latitude occurs across four experiences:  Advisory - Where students develop a sense of personal and community identity, as well as personalized learning pathways. Workshop - Where students hone foundational literacy, communication, and mathematical thinking skills. Studio - Where students investigate, document, and develop creative solutions to real challenges in Humanities and in Science and Design.  Extended Learning Opportunities - Where students engage in off campus learning, through site visits, internships, service learning experiences, and concurrent college enrollment classes.  Key actions in SY 19-20 to support implementation of Academic State Standards within this program include development and implementation of: High Quality Project Based Learning plans, which clearly identify key learning targets and essential questions aligned to the CCSS, NGSS, and CSS; opportunities for real world learning; differentiation strategies; and project milestones/benchmarks. A personalized learning model to meet the diverse needs of students, supporting mastery of state standards at their optimal pace via a Workshop model. High-quality professional development aligned to high priority instructional practices that positively impact student academic achievement and social-emotional development.  Latitude leverages diverse assessments to evaluate progress in implementation of state standards, which were selected based on their ability to inform instruction and program. These include 1) internally developed rubrics and checklists mapped against state standards, which are used monthly by the leadership team to evaluate student progress toward curricular outcomes, 2) the research-based, nationally normed NWEA MAP Assessment and PSAT Suite to gauge student growth and proficiency in English Language Arts and Mathematics, 3) the CAASPP assessments to evaluate student growth and mastery of state standards, and 4) UC/CSU course completion to evaluate college readiness.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-31|To be an educated person in the 21st century demands nothing less than global citizenship. Students are entering a world undergoing technological, cultural, linguistic, climatic, economic, and social disruption. The world students will face after they graduate will look different than the one today, both in terms of challenges and opportunities; the jobs of tomorrow look different than the jobs of today. In addition, the world is increasingly global and interconnected, requiring interdisciplinary, knowledgeable global citizens who can negotiate questions of justice and morality while grappling with the most complex problems facing our world, from climate change, to economic inequities, to international terrorism and conflict.  To be prepared for this evolving world, the vision for Latitude graduates exceeds common notions of educational attainment and academic outcomes for students. The vision of the Latitude graduate is inclusive of college and career readiness. All Latitude students will graduate with A-G transcripts and powerful experiences across a broad array of career interests. Additionally, these college and career readiness indicators are a means to deeper life outcomes for all Latitude students. These outcomes include being able to articulate goals for themselves and having the ability to fulfill them.

The survey is taken by each teacher in a facilitated focus group environment.  This setting allows the teachers to ask clarifying questions of the facilitator and each other.  The self assessment tool asks questions about the number of students taught, how many have the most current CASS aligned curriculum, and what percentage of instruction in the various content areas is rigorously aligned to the most recently adopted CASS.  The LEA chose this particular tool because it focuses on the implementation of standards in the instructional process and gives the district one number to simply and effectively measure annual progress.  In addition this tool was developed before the CDE's self-reflection tools and thus provides annual growth going back three academic years.  The 2017-18 and 2018-19 average response to the question, "Of the daily instruction your students receive from you, what percentage is rigorously aligned to the current CASS in your content area." was respectively, 75% and 84%.

37680230119594|Leonardo da Vinci Health Sciences Charter|2|Learning knowledge-age skills best occurs when students are actively engaged in authentic and meaningful learning experiences that aim to develop such 21st century skills. Rather than students passively learning isolated facts, the Charter School’s instructional program is founded on inquiry-driven, project-based learning (PBL), supported by technology.   Through project-based learning, students are better able to master creativity and critical higher order thinking as well as an inquisitive attitude, sensitivity to alternative points of view and to ethical issues, an enlarged perspective and more original and unconventional thinking.   We believe that learning best occurs when students are self-motivated and inspired to investigate, test, research, create, invent, inquire and question via hands-on projects that have meaning and relevance for them across disciplines.  We believe project-based learning capitalizes on students’ natural curiosities and methods of exploring the world around them, reality, self-awareness and more.    At their best, projects can serve a number of purposes well. They engage students over a significant period of time, spurring them to produce drafts, revise their work, and reflect on it. They foster positive cooperativeness in which each student can make a distinctive contribution. They model the kind of useful work that is carried out after the completion of school in the wider community. They allow students to discover their areas of strength and to put the best foot forward; they engender a feeling of deep involvement or flow, substituting intrinsic for extrinsic motivation.   Perhaps most important, they offer a proper venue in which to demonstrate the kinds of understandings that the student has (or has not) achieved in the course of the regular school curriculum.    The teachers and staff at LdVCS deem that learning best occurs in a collaborative environment, in which the school’s teachers, staff, parents, students, and the community work together to ensure that all students reach their highest potential. Leonardo da Vinci Health Sciences Charter School values student-centered, interactive classrooms and group projects in which student voices and opinions are valued.|4|4|4|2|4|4|4|4|2|5|4|4|4|3|4|1|5|5|3|5|5|5|4|2019-10-08|Having a specific focus throughout the content areas ensures that integrated project-based learning aspects tie these curricular areas together in a way that makes learning relevant to students and to today's society.

These coaches give one-on-one, differentiated coaching through observations, weekly data meetings, and support on instructional goals. Teachers also participate in weekly content meetings to share best practices by content and to ensure continuity and vertical alignment.

01612590130633|Lighthouse Community Charter|2|At Lighthouse Community Charter School, we are committed to providing students with a curriculum that is aligned to the standards adopted by the California Board of Education, and have embedded this commitment to quality, standards-aligned curriculum into our LCAP Goal 1: Lighthouse students are academically proficient.    We measure our progress toward this goal through student performance on the Math and ELA portions of the SBAC and the proportion of students who achieve English Proficiency as measured by the ELPAC; as well as the local measures of student achievement and growth on the NWEA Measure of Academic Progress, student achievement on the Strategic Teaching and Evaluation of Performance (STEP) reading assessment in K-4, internal curriculum audits, and internal evaluations of our curriculum implementation. This combination of indicators allows us to determine our curricular alignment to standards, our implementation of this curriculum, and student achievement in relation to measures that have been correlated to achievement on the ELA and Math SBAC.  In our 2018-19 local evaluation, we determined that our Math curriculum required strengthening in relation to its standards-alignment and rigor. In response, we adopted Open Up Math for 6-8, and piloted Eureka Math Curriculum for our K-5 program, which is being adopted across classrooms for the 2019-20 school year. Implementation of this curriculum began with a Curriculum Institute in June 2019, and will continue with quarterly professional development throughout the 2019-20 school year.   We also identified the need for a stronger, aligned, K-2 Foundational Skills program, and have adopted the EL Education Skills Block K-2 as a means of ensuring students are receiving systematic phonics and early reading instruction in these grades.   In addition, implementation of standards in 2019-20 is supported by administrator and teacher attendance at the UnboundEd Standards Institutes in summer 2019 and coaching and professional development focused on teacher understanding and implementation of CCSS in math and ELA. To support the implementation of NGSS-aligned science, we adopted Project-Based Inquiry Science for our 6-8 science program.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-06-12||Met|2019

We measure our progress toward this goal through student performance on the Math and ELA portions of the SBAC; the proportion of students who achieve English Proficiency as measured by the ELPAC; our cohort graduation and dropout rates; and our A-G completion rate. As local measures of implementation of state academic standards, we use the NWEA Measure of Academic Progress, internal curriculum and coursework audits, and internal evaluations of curriculum implementation across the subject areas. This combination of indicators allows us to determine our curricular alignment to standards, implementation of this curriculum, and student achievement in relation to measures that have been correlated to achievement on the ELA and Math SBAC.    As a result of our internal evaluations, we identified standards-based English and HIstory curriculum as a place for improvement. In response, we adopted Match, a CCSS-aligned, college-prepratory English program and New Visions Social Studies. We are in the third year of rolling out an Integrated Math sequence.

LAUSD is at full implementation of the English Language Arts (ELA), English Language Development (ELD) and mathematics standards. Teachers have been provided professional learning opportunities on the new ELA and mathematics standards since 2011. LAUSD has implemented new ELA/ELD instructional programs for grades K-12 since 2017. LAUSD continues to support early literacy foundational skills instruction through our Early Language and Literacy Plan by offering intensive professional development and teacher materials to 520 elementary school teams to support differentiated instruction for students. In June 2018, LAUSD adopted a new English Learner and Standard English Learner Master Plan. Mandatory professional development district-wide this year on the new Master Plan will support the implementation of the ELD standards. Schools continue to track English Learner progress with an online dashboard with real-time data.  LAUSD began implementing new mathematics standards and curricula in the 2014-15 school year. LAUSD has expanded implementation of Cognitively Guided Instruction over 120 elementary schools in order to improve student performance. Interventions and new math pathways are being implemented in the secondary grades as well. Schools have been utilizing the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA) interim assessment blocks aligned to ELA and mathematics since Fall 2015. The district uses these data to identify supports and resources that schools may need during the school year. LAUSD continues implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the Career Technical Education standards. LAUSD implemented new high school HSS instructional materials in Fall 2018 and in grades K-8 in Fall 2019. LAUSD continues to partner with the Stanford History Education Group to provide training to HSS teachers. Since the state adoption of the NGSS in 2013, LAUSD has provided extensive professional development on the NGSS and the instructional shifts necessary for classroom implementation. New high school NGSS curricula was implemented in Fall of 2019 and K-8 materials will be implemented in Fall 2020. District-wide teacher leader cohorts have been developing sample units, assessments, and professional development to build the capacity of schools to implement the NGSS.

19753330000000|Manhattan Beach Unified|2|MBUSD utilized the SBAC ELA and math scores and Advanced Placement (AP) results as metrics for measuring implementation related to student outcomes. In grades three through eight and eleven, 86% of our students met or exceeded standards in ELA, and 80% met or exceeded standards in mathematics. The four-year trend in ELA and math shows an increase of 5% and 9% respectively. While we have made steady gains in ELA since the inception of the SBAC, our gains in math improved at a faster rate than our gains in English. The percentage of MBUSD seniors who completed at least one AP class with an exam score of three or above was 67%.  MBUSD strives to ensure that all students learn at high levels. Within our Personalized Learning Framework, we take collective responsibility to help each child grow academically, socially, and emotionally and use evidence of learning to ensure student success. We have committed to sending certificated staff in all subject areas to Professional Learning Community Institutes and classified staff to conferences aligned with their roles.   Based on these metrics, we have identified that the majority of our stakeholders believe we meet and/or exceed expectations in regards to implementing CA State Academic Standards, and that student access to resources and standards-based instruction results in positive student outcomes.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-09-04||Met|2019

A modified version of the CA state metric to measure the implementation of all other state standards was utilized. We selected these metrics and subsequent reflective survey tool to accurately analyze and reflect current implementation school wide. MESD has purchased state adopted ELA/ELD curriculums Benchmark Advance for TK-5th grade and Study Sync for 6th-8th grades. Engage New York/Eureka Math and the Aleks program have been purchased to utilize in our current Math programs. Continued professional development for all faculty and staff ensures successful implementation which also focuses on the implementation of EL standards. After analyzing the data, the majority of all faculty in ELA and Mathematics fall into Level 4, "Student Awareness" . Evidence of successful implementation includes adoption of CCSS aligned curriculums, PD on that curriculum, weekly allotted time for all faculty and staff to collaborate and analyze curriculum embedded assessments, CAASPP scores, CELDT scores, pacing guides, and create school wide thematic project learning designed to reinforce California State Standards in all subject areas. We are exploring Science and History Curriculums which includes examination, piloting, and selection of standards based materials. In the coming years, Manzanita Elementary School District will increase our focus and implementation of Social Science Framework and the Next Generation Science Standards. MESD will continue to utilize BCOE's CA Standards Implementation Metric and a modified version of the CA state metric to measure the implementation of all state standards utilized.

21653180000000|Miller Creek Elementary|2|The Miller Creek School District continues to prioritize high quality instruction and fully implement curriculum that aligns with the California state standards.  During the 2018-19 school year, the District led an initiative in articulating a balanced literacy program with a focus on developing an independent reading program and designing small group,targeted reading instruction. Professional development focused on the administering of common assessments and using the data to monitor student growth according to the standards.  Teachers implemented and tracked common standards based assessment data in the area of reading and mathematics using our state approved curriculum as an instructional map.   The District has a thorough process for examining, piloting and selecting instructional materials. After a pilot of approved materials, the teacher curriculum committee recommends materials to the school board to consider for adoption.   During the 2018-19 school year, the District followed this procedure to adopt a new NGSS aligned science program in grades 6-8. The new program will be implemented during the 2019-20 school year with professional development that includes content development, understanding the scope and sequence of learning segments, and coaching from the publisher.   The District will continue this process for Science in grades TK-5. A committee piloted different options during the 2018-19 school year and this year will select and adopt the new curriculum for implementation in the 2020-21 school year.   Annually teachers have 3 contracted PD days, weekly teacher collaboration time through student early release and provided release time through creation of a master schedule, and additional opportunities for district and county collaboration throughout the year. The District surveyed teachers to support staff in identifying learning needs in order to design and deliver instruction aligned to the adopted academic standards. Teachers develop annual goals that reflect the LEA’s goals to identify areas of growth.   The district offers a thriving world language program in grades 6-8 that uses a newly adopted curriculum that is aligned with state academic standards.  The District had a committee of teachers attend a series of professional development workshops through partnership with the Marin County Office of Education to understand the new History Social Science framework and the shifts needed in curriculum. This exploration will continue during the 2019-20 school year with a larger group of educators.|4|4|5|3|3|5|5|5|4|3|5|4|5|4|3|3|4|5|5|5|5|5|4|2019-10-08||Met|2019

Every teacher that teaches the subject under consideration was a part of the decision of adoption; we are currently piloting science program which again was agreed upon by the teachers in TK-8.  Additionally, Millville School reviews the results of the CAASPP annually and throughout the year to determine standards that may need additional time and resources. The CAASPP results are reviewed as a entire school, per grade, by socioeconomic groups, and by gender. Our review includes identifying specific standards that fall below "Standards Met" on the CAASPP and then identifying why. If there is a weakness in the curriculum that was identified through CAASPP scores and local assessments, additional resources are sought and reviewed to fill in the identified gaps in standards achievement.|5|1|5|3|4|5|1|5|4|4|4|2|4|4|4|3|4|5|4|2|5|5|4|2019-10-22|Millville School does not have an English Language Development population.

37682210000000|National Elementary|2|National School District (NSD) has focused on implementing Common Core State Standards beginning with a targeted emphasis on Mathematics and English Language Arts.  The district adopted reading/language arts materials from Benchmark and American Reading Corporation for grades TK-6.  Benchmark materials include digital and consumable student books in both English and Spanish.  The American Reading Corporation materials include at least five baskets of leveled books for each classroom in English and Spanish.  TK uses Touchmath while the remainder of the grade levels, kindergarten-sixth grade, use Houghton-Mifflin’s Go Math.  To supplement the Go Math curriculum, we are also using the University of California, Irvine’s Math Projects’ materials.  The Go Math and UCI math materials are available in English and Spanish for all grade levels. Professional learning has provided support for the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics. Further professional learning has been provided using the ELA/ELD Framework to build educator capacity. District Resource Teachers presented the ELA/ELD framework to teachers last school year and will continue providing professional development for the ELA/ELD Framework and the ELD Roadmap.  The resource teachers are also available to support teachers with any instructional needs that they may have. Consultants from Benchmark, American Reading Corporation and the UCI Math Project have also provided professional development learning sessions for teachers. For English Language Development, NSD uses Systematic English Language Development as our designated ELD program for our English Learners. Teachers have been trained on programmatic elements, ongoing language support, and on using formative, weekly, and unit assessments to guide their instruction. Integrated English Language Development remains a priority to assist with providing content support for our English learners. National School District is fortunate to have had 60 teachers participate in an intensive Next Generation Science Standards California Math and Science Project grant. They will lead the charge as we move forward with adopting materials to support NGSS. We continue to use previously adopted History-Social Science materials to provide grade specific lessons. IReady is being utilized to inform teachers about their students’ progress in reading/language arts and math. The National School District has implemented data teams district-wide. Teachers are released five hours per month to analyze student data and collaborate in delivering instruction aligned with the Common Core State Standards. While classroom teachers are meeting in data teams to review the progress of students and determine next steps, enrichment teachers take over the class and provide health, physical education, and visual and performing arts instruction. The enrichment teachers are highly trained and develop lessons on the most current curricula standards.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-23||Met|2019

Administrators and teacher leaders have attended trainings that will assist in the continued support of our EL population.  NP3 utilizes professional learning communities to identify essential standards, build curriculum and assessments that are aligned to the standards, and to support  teachers in determining areas for growth and improvement. There is a heavy focus across content areas on the development of critical thinking and problem solving skills, as well as an emphasis on collaboration, project-based learning, and effective use of technology. The culture of collaboration at NP3 extends beyond the classroom and applies to the work that is done between teacher partners, subject area departments, and among administrators. Teachers have ample time for collaboration and professional development, as NP3 has built in an early release day for students weekly. This provides time for teachers to work on curricular frameworks, design lesson plans, and evaluate student success in meeting the academic standards. In addition, informal walkthroughs and formal observations are done by both administrators and colleagues to support the delivering of standards aligned instruction.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-15||Met|2019

NUSD has been using the Smarter Balanced Assessment interim assessment blocks aligned to ELA and math since 2017. The IABs enable us to monitor our performance and progress. This tool is aligned to Common Core State Standards, uses computer-adaptive question types, and benchmarks our student progress in comparison to the annual summative assessment.  The implementation of Common Core State Standards is also monitored through classroom and Professional Learning Community (PLC) walkthroughs. This data is reported to the Board multiple times a year in both Board communications and at Board meetings through presentations and study sessions.   School leaders are provided support through monthly district administration meetings which focus on our “4 commitments” (formative feedback, site-based professional development, use of our NUSD System of Assessments, and implementation of quality PLCs.) Site administrators are also receive on-going, non-evaluative support by a coach who facilitates triads of principals in best practice discussions and supports school leaders through dilemmas. Administrators are also provided support by the supervisors of schools and directors which occurs individually on the school site on a regular basis.   This work, building an aligned instructional system, is important work for our staff to undertake to improve student achievement in NUSD. At the same time, this work is especially complicated in Natomas because of the high mobility rate of our students (1 in 2 third graders attended kindergarten in our district, 4 in 5 sixth graders attended fifth grade in our district, and only 50% of our graduates were enrolled at the same high school in 9th grade).|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-09-11||Met|2019

Additionally, we review curriculum-embedded assessments to inform daily teaching and learning in both curricular areas.   2. Description of why we chose these measures or tools: We have chosen MAP because it personalizes each formative assessment by adapting test questions to each student’s learning level. As a result, the MAP scores help the LEA understand every student’s current achievement level and plan instruction and academic support accordingly. As an LEA, reports are created and analyzed (district, school, grade, class, and individual student levels). We administer MAP three times annually (Fall, Winter and Spring). We monitor and analyze data after each MAP and curriculum-embedded assessment through ongoing Cycles of Inquiry with school administrators and teachers.    3. Summary of Progress: ELA - After gathering multiple measures of academic performance data from the site, the teachers and principal agree there are many factors influencing very low student performance. With a developing awareness of the California (CA) ELA standards, shifts in teaching pedagogy, and a newly adopted curriculum, various professional development opportunities are needed. As a result, the district hired a Director of Educational Services to support and monitor both Curriculum and Instruction and provide support and resources in order for successful Assessment and Accountability reporting.  Math: After gathering multiple measures of academic performance data from the site, the teachers and principal agree there are many factors influencing very low student performance.  With a developing awareness of the CA Math standards, there is a need for increased understanding of the CA Math standards, academic rigor, and teaching mathematics processes, proficiencies and pedagogy. Professional development is an ongoing need in the areas of developing explicit learning targets and a Gradual Release Model (GRM) of implementation involving high levels of student engagement. As a result, the district hired a Director of Educational Services to support and monitor Curriculum and Instruction as well as Assessment and Accountability reporting.  In order to focus district priorities and resources, three district-wide goals have been created for current and subsequent years:  Goal 1:  Implement a Standards-Based Core Curriculum, including                Reading and Math Interventions, for low performing students.  Goal 2:  Involve all stakeholders in strengthening learning environments                that are effective, engaging and safe.

As an LEA, reports are created and analyzed (District, School, Grade, Class, and Individual Student levels).   We administer NWEA MAP assessments three times annually (Fall, Winter and Spring). We monitor and analyze data after each MAP assessment and curriculum embedded assessment through ongoing Cycles of Inquiry with School Administrators and Teachers.   3. Summary of Progress: ELA - After gathering multiple measures of academic performance data from the site, the Teacher and Principal agree there are many factors influencing low student performance. With a developing awareness of the CA ELA Standards, shifts in teaching pedagogy, and a newly adopted curriculum, various professional development opportunities have been identified. As a result, the District hired a Director of Educational Services to support and monitor both Curriculum and Instruction and provide support and resources in order for successful Assessment and Accountability reporting.  Math: After gathering multiple measures of academic performance data from the site, the Teacher and Principal agree there are many factors influencing low student performance.  With a developing awareness of the CA Math standards, there is a need for increased understanding of the CA Math Standards, academic rigor,  and teaching mathematical processes,  proficiencies and pedagogy. Professional development is an ongoing need in the areas of developing explicit learning targets and a Gradual Release Model (GRM) of implementation involving high levels of student engagement. As a result, the District hired a Director of Educational Services to support and monitor Curriculum and Instruction as well as Assessment and Accountability reporting.  In order to focus district priorities and resources, three district-wide goals have been created for current and subsequent years:  Goal 1:  Implement a Standards-Based Core Curriculum, including                Reading and Math Interventions, for low performing students.  Goal 2:  Involve all stakeholders in strengthening learning environments                that are effective, engaging and safe.  Goal 3: Increase Average Daily Attendance                            Based on these district- wide goals, a strategic Academic Plan has been             created.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-17|4.

We chose this metric to ensure all teachers have full awareness of the common core standards in all subject areas and that they are moving toward full implementation. The levels of implementation are initial awareness (for teachers), developing awareness (for teachers), full awareness (for teachers), student awareness and full implementation (for students).  ELA: Currently, half of the staff moved up to the student awareness level and in some areas of the standards are in full implementation. The focus for our teachers continues to be writing and getting students to be able to state the learning goals.  Math: The majority of the staff noted that they have moved up the implementation rubric, identifying that they are at the student awareness level. Our teachers have well-planned units and lessons aligned to the new standards. They have formative and summative assessments to monitor individual student progress. Our goal is to use assessment data to drive more individualized instruction.  Science: The majority of our teachers have identified that they are at the full awareness level. Staff will be looking at purchasing Next Generation Science Standards aligned textbooks for next year.

Teachers developed a metric for measuring which standards are covered in each project over the 6-year plan span, and implemented a method for documenting which standards students have met. Teachers also re-evaluated and updated rubrics and benchmark data so they can better analyze formative assessment data and determine student growth. A new method was devised for documenting and analyzing post-project leadership skills assessment results over a six-year period. NWP Student work is evaluated using one-on-one, small groups, and seminar methods. Students demonstrate proficiency in the use of digital tools for research (accessing information), evaluating sources, digital citizenship, communication, collaboration, and problem solving for college and career readiness. NWP’s Crossroads classes focus on career and college readiness and completion of student portfolios. Portfolio Defense is required yearly and used as a reflective means of measuring personal and academic growth.

15634040120139|Nueva Vista Language Academy|2|Professional development and collaboration are key components of the instructional program at Nueva Vista Language Academy. Two late start Wednesdays per month are dedicated to teacher training and structured planning time where teachers discuss instructional practices, review assessment results, and design lessons with a specific focus on addressing gaps in student learning.  In addition, teachers are given extra collaboration and planning time as needed to ensure they meet the needs of all learners, including English language learners, Foster youth, and McKinney-Vento students. All teachers and administrators have received training in reading strategies, English learner methods, mathematics, and technology. Nueva Vista Language Academy utilizes academic coaches in the areas of new teacher support, Mathematics, English Language Arts, English language development, and technology; these individuals model and design lessons, assist with curriculum development, and collaborate with individual teachers to improve instructional practices. A member of each grade level serves as a district curriculum facilitator to support curriculum development and implementation process by creating pacing guides, instructional materials and assessments.  Teachers have also participated in the Next Generation Science Standards roll-out training, and teachers in each grade level will pilot new curriculum to ensure the curriculum meets the state standards for learning.  NVLA is in the second year of implementation of Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID); it is now a school-wide program to ensure each student is prepared for lifelong learning.  AVID focuses on instruction and a college-going culture for all students.  In the classroom, students follow lessons in writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization skills, and reading.  Beginning in kindergarten, students begin AVID folders for organization and tracking their learning through data, and that strategy continues through fifth grade as students track their reading data and specific assessments.  Another school-wide academic initiative is the professional learning and implementation of Thinking Maps.  Thinking Maps consists of eight visual patterns that assist students in organizing their thought process and obtain a higher level of thinking. Nueva Vista Language Academy has a group of teachers and administrators who have been trained as trainers, and the team has put on several professional learning opportunities for teachers.  In the classroom, teachers are implementing the use of Thinking Maps in all content areas. Students use Thinking Maps as a guide for speaking and writing.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-14|Nueva Vista Language Academy is driven by multiple data sources.

38769190132159|OnePurpose|2|OnePurpose School (OP) is committed to ensuring its curriculum is aligned to the academic standards adopted by the State Board of Education and developed Goal 1 of its Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) to support this work. GOAL: Rigorous, Engaging, Standards-aligned Curriculum - OP believes that all students can learn at high levels and that authentic engagement, high expectations and academic rigor are the key curricular drivers for student learning. ACTIONS: 1) Academic program that represents a broad course of study, including English, mathematics, science and engineering, social science, visual and performing arts, physical education and health, Spanish, and English language development. 2) Curriculum maps and unit plans for each grade level and subject area in alignment with the CCSS, CSS, NGSS, and ELDS. 3) Professional development yearly before, during, and after the school year, including ELD. 4) Baseline, formative, and summative assessments in alignment with CCSS, CSS, NGSS, and ELDS standards. ASSESSMENT: Local Indicators include: 1) Annual audits of curriculum by the Leadership Team, 2) Stakeholder satisfaction as measured by the research-based and nationally normed School Climate Assessment Indicators (SCAI) assessment, and 3) Student growth on the research-based Fountas and Pinnell Reading Assessment (FPRA). RESULTS: The Annual Audit of curriculum found the ELA, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies curriculum required strengthened alignment to the CCSS and NGSS. As a result, new research-based curriculum was adopted and is being implemented in 2019-20. The SCAI data found a dip in levels of satisfaction with Learning and Assessment (Dimension 6), with average ratings of 3.93 by Families, 3.33 by Students (Grade 3 and up only), and 3.05 by Staff. Ratings of 3.5 or higher are correlated with increased academic achievement. On the FPRA, 60% of students overall were at or above grade level in Reading. PROGRESS: OP engaged in specific actions, as detailed in the LCAP, that realized progress toward the goal. 1) Broad Course of Study - OP continued it’s core curriculum offerings of English, Mathematics, Science and Engineering, and Social Studies, as well as Integrated and Designated English Language Development and Spanish. Due to an unexpected mid-year faculty departure, the enrichment program was shifted. Previously physical education and the arts were taught in an integrated program through Capoiera. This shifted mid-year to a more traditional physical education program. 2) Standards Aligned Curriculum - OP continued to root its English Language Arts program in the workshop model, using Zoophonics to support Phonics development, Lucy Calkins Reading and Writing Workshops, and the Jan Richardson Model to support Guided Reading.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-06-11|A new math curriculum was piloted, based on the materials developed and used at Rocketship (and some of these were used in ELA as well). Social Studies and Science and Engineering were taught through Project Based Learning Units. The Rocketship resources were determined to not be a fit for our school and student population. A comprehensive curriculum adoption will take place for 2019-20. 3) Professional Development - Teachers received professional development before, during, and after the school year with 15 pupil free days and weekly early releases (three hours) to support new inputs, ongoing support in implementation, collaboration, and conferencing. The number of days was reduced from 20 to 15 based on teacher feedback in 2017-18, as the extra days extended the school year past the last of school for the neighborhood schools, which caused challenges with morale and attendance. 4) Assessments - OP continued its use of classroom-based assessments, including guided reading logs, to provide ongoing data to inform instruction. The Fountas and Pinnell Reading Assessment and the NWEA Measures of Academic Progress were used to provide benchmark data, in turn measuring rates of growth for students as well as overall proficiency. On the NWEA, 46% of students grew their percentile ranking in ELA and 54% in Math.|Met|2019

19647330101675|Oscar De La Hoya Animo Charter High|2|The school offers a standards aligned curriculum to ensure students are provided with rigorous grade level content in all core classes. Curriculum Directors and Curriculum Specialists developed the ELA, Math, Science and History “Course at a Glance” materials and curriculum maps that are aligned to CA Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards. All materials are available to all teachers via Green Dot's online platform. Additional curricular resources available online include model unit plans, lesson plans and summative assessments. ELA and Math intervention courses (Literacy Intervention, Math Foundation and Academic English Essentials) are offered at all grade levels to ensure students below grade level received targeted supports to meet their needs and work towards mastery on state assessments. English Learners also receive specialized support through ELD courses, based on their English proficiency levels, as well as through their designated supports in literacy intervention. Teachers receive 2 professional development sessions per week and coaching from content-specific curriculum specialists as needed. Professional development has been provided to all teachers on the Common Core literacy standards as well as their content specific standards. Green Dot utilizes the train-the-trainer model providing instructional leadership team members in each content area ongoing support in curriculum development and instructional strategies through department meetings and collaboration. Green Dot uses the Reading Inventory and iReady assessments to measure the literacy and math gains of each student. Students take both assessments three times per year for progress monitoring. For the 2018-2019 school year, 70% of students met their Growth Goal in Reading Inventory; 38% of students met their Growth Goal in iReady. In addition to these nationally normed assessments, Green Dot interim assessments are aligned to both Common Core content standards and Literacy standards to expose students to rigorous assessments and provide teachers with data to inform instruction and re-teaching as needed. In recent state assessment data for 2018-2019, 55% of students met or exceeded the standard in ELA. In order to continue to push growth the school will continue to focus on school-wide literacy strategies and the use of data to respond to student needs. In recent state assessment data for 2018-2019, 20% of students met or exceeded the standard in Math. In order to continue to push growth, the school will continue to implement a common-core aligned math curriculum and professional development focused on teaching math for conceptual understanding. Additionally, Green Dot schools receive student growth percentiles based on state assessment data from CORE. The school is in the 79 and 89 percentiles in ELA and math, respectively.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-11-01||Met|2019

23655576116669|Pacific Community Charter|2|In the January of 2018, the Pacific School initiated the NWEA MAP Growth program for use as a local performance assessment for all students, grades K through 12. NWEA MAP growth is a research based, online assessment tool that provides individual, class, and schoolwide performance data. The first assessment was delivered in winter 2017 providing hands-on experience for teachers and students as they became familiar with the program. This was followed by an additional assessment in the spring. NWEA was used in the fall of 2018 for both formative assessment and to establish baseline data. The MAP Growth assessment was delivered to students three times during the 2018-19 school year; fall, winter and spring. The Pacific School will continue this schedule each school year. “Screening” and “Skills Checklists” assessments are available through NWEA and will aid teachers in identifying and targeting needed student supports in reading and mathematics.  The Pacific School is also implementing a whole child approach to academic achievement based on the Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) initiative. MTSS identifies a comprehensive assessment system to provide support and intervention for all students, which includes Academic, Behavioral, and Social-Emotional evaluation and instruction. MTSS also embraces Administrative Leadership, an Integrated Educational Framework, Family and Community Engagement and an Inclusive Policy Structure and Practice.  State adopted standards have been implemented in all course offerings at the Pacific School, including the implementation of a hybrid 6th through 8th grade classroom structure, in math and science, that involves some portions of the curriculum to be delivered through on-line sources. The course of study at the Pacific High School addresses the State Standards across the curriculum. The high school program provides access to and meets all requirements for UC, A-G college admissions requirements as well as AP courses.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-23||Met|2019
44697810000000|Pacific Elementary|2|PESD is making notable progress in implementing state academic standards.  In 2017, PESD adopted a new ELA/ELD curriculum and the publisher provided professional development to facilitate implementation.  Most teachers use this (Benchmark) as their core curriculum and then supplement with various materials and strategies.  Our adopted mathematics curriculum is old and most teachers use it only sparingly.  As a result, each teacher uses a variety of different materials.  There is not a consensus on a new adoption so instead, the school has contracted with a consultant to provide coaching in mathematics instruction.  Last year, PESD adopted the FOSS science curriculum.  We are also active participants in Bay Sci - an intensive county-wide professional development effort designed to help understand the NGSS better.   The History-Social Science curriculum is also old but still popular with teachers.  It is being used as the main curriculum in most classes and there is frequent supplementation in many classes.  While there is no PE curriculum, teachers are diligent about teaching PE standards.  PESD has a rich VAPA program, including a dedicated music instructor who works with each class.  We also contract with a drama teacher who directs an elaborate school play.  Classroom teachers provide instruction in visual arts.|4|5|5|5|2|5|5|3|5|2|4|4|5|4|2|4|3|4|4|2|4|4|3|2019-10-15||Met|2019

12629760000000|Pacific Union Elementary|2|Pacific Union School’s staff includes thirty-three certificated staff members and two certificated administrators. Twenty-three are grade level teachers. Eleven of the teachers have ten or more years experience and six have five or fewer years of experience. Grades transitional kindergarten through sixth are taught in self-contained classrooms, and seventh and eighth grade students are taught in departmentalized classrooms. The district has one special day classroom. Students are also supported by these certificated staff: a reading intervention teacher, a speech-language pathologist, counselors, a school psychologist, three resource specialist teachers, an English Learner teacher, music teacher, and a PE teacher.  District teachers worked in grade levels to identify the local educational agency’s progress in implementing the academic state standards. The district selected this option due to the small staff size and the collaborative nature of the process. The results of those collaborations are: The district is fully implementing Common Core State Standards (CCSS) math; teachers in grades transitional kindergarten through fifth are implementing EngageNY; and teachers in grades sixth through eighth are implementing Big Ideas. In the area of English Language Arts, the district began implementing the Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) program in grades transitional kindergarten through third in spring, 2017. Fountas and Pinnell classroom curriculum is fully implemented in grades transitional kindergarten through third and fourth through sixth are in the early stages of implementation. Grades seventh and eighth are exploring alternatives to the State Board of Education adopted list of English Language Arts programs. Pacific Union School began utilizing the National Geographic Reach curriculum in its English Language program in 2014, which is fully implemented and sustainable. Instructional materials that are aligned to the CCSS ELA and math are available for all students in all classrooms where the subject is taught.  The district is in the beginning development stage of Next Generation Science Standards and in the exploration and research phase for Common Core State Standards social studies curriculum.  The LEA fully utilized the Educator Effectiveness grant and district funds to provide collaboration time and professional development in the areas of CCSS math and CCSS ELA. The LEA also provided conference and workshop opportunities to learn about curriculum frameworks and curriculum options in science and social studies.  Additionally, Pacific Union School is utilizing standards-based report cards in grades transitional kindergarten through fifth. Transitional kindergarten through second grade also utilizes CoreGrowth, a standards-based assessment system.

19647336018642|Pacoima Charter Elementary|2|Pacoima Charter School implements a variety of researched based academic programs that address the California Common Core Standards, such as Success for All Reading Program, HMH Science, Ready Math, and Reach.  Supplemental programs and resources are utilized to enhance lessons.  Students are academically challenged on a daily basis through informal and formal assessments and observations, supplemental learning tools and interventions to address the needs of our different subgroups. PCS uses I-ready Diagnostic Benchmarks to assess students’ progress in mastering CCSS in math and reading. We chose the I-Ready Benchmark because it is an adaptive assessment tool that provides us with a more accurate view of where students are in regards to their understanding of ELA and math standards. We use the information to guide our instruction and determine areas of where professional development is needed. We also use writing performance tasks to measure students’ progress in writing as well as their understanding of science and social studies concepts. In addition, we use the assessments provided by our HMH science program to monitor students’ progress with NGSS.  In regards to ELD, students’ progress is monitored using ELD portfolios and REACH assessments.  Differentiation of instruction through tutoring and online programs is making a difference in student performance. Student knowledge of standards and expectations is growing and continue to impact student learning.  Students know their goals through discussions and their goals are posted.  Student-teacher conferences allow students to understand ways to improve.  The Success for All program at Pacoima Charter School has provided consistent language arts strategies that is implemented through each grade level.  Supplemental resources and programs have been used to enhance the skills taught.  For example, students are encouraged to read with access to digital materials and educational websites obtained by the school librarian.  Children are given time to read, for enjoyment, every morning with the Drop Everything and Read program.  The dedicated English Language Development block of time, found in every grade level, allows teachers to address specific ELD common core standards using the REACH program which is aligned to CA ELD standards.  The students who struggle in language arts are given support to ensure their success.  Students receive one-on-one tutoring using the computerized programs Alphie’s Alley and Team Alphie. These programs are customized to the students’ needs and implement strategies used in the Success for All reading program.    The Ready Classroom Math!

54720330000000|Palo Verde Union Elementary|2|Effective implementation of all state content and performance standards is critical for student success. Palo Verde’s efforts to implement new state standards started in 2014 with professional development in the Common Core standards in English/Language Arts, Mathematics, and English Language Development. At the same time, we continued to support our full implementation of all other state adopted content and performance standards. Through our continuous improvement efforts, we continue to make significant investment in all aspects of implementation and sustainability. Local evaluation includes examination of the impact of multiple criteria including recruitment and retention of highly effective teachers, tiered professional development geared to teachers’ and school professional development plans, standards-aligned core instructional materials, multi-dimensional supplementary materials for differentiation of instruction, remedial and intervention programs targeting specific student learning needs, schoolwide literacy programs and strategies (such as “designated” and “integrated” English language development and schoolwide learning strategies, local benchmark testing to allow timely intervention and remediation, local examination of student work, and administrative support and monitoring. This evaluation is accomplished through annual teacher and staff surveys, administrative monitoring of lesson plans, mentored observation and coaching in the classroom, and other local records. Each action and service is evaluated based on its impact on student learning. Results confirm that we have achieved “full implementation” or “full implementation and sustainability” in: English/Language Arts, English Language Development, Mathematics, Health, History/Social Science, Visual and Performing Arts, and Physical Education. We also have fully implemented the previous state science standards and are currently in the process of transitioning to the Next Generation Science Standards.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-09||Met|2019

These tools are STAR360, IXL, and CAASPP annual data. Both the STAR360 and IXL programs were chosen due to their ability to pinpoint gaps in both individual and school-wide achievement, as well as ability to provide support and scaffolding to help to close these gaps. CAASPP data is used as an indicator of progress on a year-to-year basis.

19648730000000|Paramount Unified|2|Paramount USD's LCAP includes a wide range of activities and services to support the implementation of state academic standards. These include professional development in Language Arts, ELD, mathematics, NGSS/science, History Social Science, Health, Career Technical Education and Instructional Technology to develop the capacity of teacher leaders, academic coaches and principals.  Teacher teams write high quality curriculum guides and assessments to guide the implementation of standards based instruction and monitor academic progress throughout the year.  PUSD’s LCAP includes two measures to assess this priority: 1) the number of Lead Teachers who support professional development and 2) the percent of Lead Teachers who participate in professional development.  These measures align with the district’s emphasis on developing the capacity of teachers to implement state standards.  Lead Teachers PUSD has a long standing commitment to developing teacher leadership. Lead Teachers play a leadership role at all schools by supporting implementation of professional development and providing collegial support for implementing instruction based on standards. The role of the Lead Teacher has developed the capacity of each school to support teachers as they apply inquiry, questioning and increased rigor for all.  Target: 40 Lead Teachers     Outcome: 58 Lead Teachers    Target: Met   Lead Teachers Participating in Professional Development The transition to new standards in ELA, ELD, math,  science and a new History Social Science Framework speak to the need for high quality professional development. In person and on line professional development is offered in summer, winter break and throughout the school year.  When new textbooks are adopted, PUSD provides professional development to assure teachers understand the new materials and are confident in using them.  As an example, new, Integrated Science texts are being implemented in grades 6-8 in 2019-20; in preparation, all middle school science teachers were invited to attend a two-day science institute in summer, 2019.  Lead Teachers attended sessions with principals to learn about a K-12 Instructional Framework, The Five Dimensions of Teaching and Learning.  Each year we survey teachers on how professional development helps them deliver standards based instruction.  Over 85% of K-8 teachers surveyed stated that professional development provided supported their instruction. In grades 9-12, between 68-78%, depending on the content area, stated professional development supported the implementation of standards.  100% of Lead Teachers attended professional development sessions related to their content area; however, due to the fact that some sessions took place after school, 85% of Lead Teachers met the target of attending 95% of all meetings.

42767866045918|Peabody Charter|2|Peabody Charter School (PCS) uses a variety of measures to track its progress in implementing the state academic standards.   One measure PCS has chosen to use is survey data collected from each grade level and teacher about progress toward implementing the standards.  This is gathered annually and is linked to goals in the school’s LCAP.  Other tools include data collected during grade level Professional Learning Community (PLC) time, staff meeting discussions, and release time provided specifically to make progress in exactly these areas.  PCS has made progress in implementing the standards for math, ELA, ELD, and science.  We are in the fourth year of using a new standards-based and aligned ELA/ELD curriculum in grades K-5. We are in the first year of using a standards-based math curriculum.  We are in the fourth year of using a standards-aligned science curriculum.  In the 2017-18 school year, PCS piloted a school-wide common assessment for both reading and math, and we have adopted this program for the 2019-20 school year for grades K-6.  These assessments are aligned to the state standards and will provide teachers with formative data that they can use throughout the year to better tailor their instruction to student need.  PCS has particular goals this year in the area of science instruction and math.  With the LCAP calling for an increase in both the frequency and quality of science instruction for all students, PCS has made significant progress in this area.  We have purchased more materials, provided additional training, and rearranged school-wide schedules to help facilitate progress toward this goal. The next steps will include identifying where and how science can converge with other subjects.  We have purchased new math materials for grades K-5 and are looking to implement the new program with fidelity.   This idea of identifying where curricular areas overlap, integrate, or support each other – where they ‘converge’ – is an overarching school-wide goal.  Now with history-social science standards on the horizon, it is clear that we simply cannot continue to think about each curricular area in isolation.  The limitation of time in the school day requires PCS to find ways to integrate each standards-based area to the greatest extent possible.    Speaking specifically to the history-social science standards, like the rest of the state, PCS is currently learning more about this newly adopted standards and is in the emerging stages of implementation.  As our understanding grows, we will be able to direct appropriate time and resources to their integration into our overall program.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-17||Met|2019

07617880000000|Pittsburg Unified|2|PUSD is using a variety of tools and measures to track progress in implementing Academic Standards, these include LCAP/LCFF reports on status and public meetings; internal reviews of Central Office staff; hiring processes; curriculum adoption processes, presentations and approvals; observations and walk-throughs; professional development schedules and artifacts; coaching docs; and Board presentations and documents that provide qualitative information on the status of curricula, courses, expanded learning and professional learning.  In addition, a tool summarizing high-level indicators of progress was presented at the Oct 23, 2019 Board meeting regarding Local Indicators.  Highlights of status and progress:  Every Fall at the beginning of the school year (Sep 26, 2019) the Board reviews and passes a Resolution on the Sufficiency of Materials, including listings of current curricular adoptions in key academic areas.  English Language Arts, Math and ELD - PUSD has aligned materials with the CA Common Core State Standards,  In ELA new curricula have been adopted in the last three years for grades K-5, with professional development and coaching supports for shifts in instruction; and adoptions are underway Grades 9-12.  Aligned Maths curricula are in place, with limited specialized adoptions still in process, e.g., Pre-Calculus.  We have implemented online interim assessments in ELA and Math, aligned with the CCCSS and the SBAC; and are supporting teachers with data for helping to group students and personalize instruction; at the middle school level the online assessments also identify/provide online supplemental instructional resources/programs, identified based on students' performance on the assessment, to augment standards-based classroom instruction.  Our LCAP/LCFF actions/strategies support alignment with CCCSS in multiple ways, including through an Early Literacy initiative that involves aligned-materials, professional learning and coaching opportunities; the use of Performance Tasks in Math (known as MARS Tasks); and use of supplemental evidence-based online learning resources in ELA for English Learners (Imagine Learning).  We have moved forward as feasible with engaging in and aligning materials and teaching and learning opportunities with Next Generation Science Standards, though still awaiting key guidance from the State regarding an NGSS curriculum adoption process.  In History-Social Science our secondary schools are in process of adoptions and elementary is providing access to materials and supporting with professional development to continue to better align with CCCSS (e.g., Understanding by Design curriculum framework).  PUSD has substantially expanded access to AP courses and Career Technical Education Pathways, as reported in our LCAP (June 5, 2019).  Parcel Task Measure and PUSD's own investments have expanded access to Music teachers and to a new standards-based music curricula.

30666470000000|Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified|2|Stakeholder survey data along with a district-developed self-analysis were used to quantify progress in standards implementation.  Local survey data regarding the implementation of State Standards has been collected for several years. As such, this measure was selected in response to this Local Indicator.  Survey data from 1,021 teachers reflects that 97% report “Standards are communicated effectively in my classroom” and 98% Completely Agree or Somewhat agree “Our staff sets high academic expectations for students.”  Parents concur with staff; 90% of the 7,548 respondents indicated “Classroom instruction prepares my child for the next grade level.”   Additionally, 93% of the 690 support staff members stated, “Our staff sets high expectations for students.”   In order to provide an additional metric for this Local Indicator, a self-analysis tool was designed.   The rubric tool contains four metrics: Stage 1: Research and Investigation, Stage 2: Initial Implementation, Stage 3: Substantial Implementation, and Stage 4: Full Implementation.  Educational Services Division staff evaluated each content area.   In 2017-2018, the District adopted content-aligned Enlgish Language Arts (ELA) and English Language Development (ELD) materials at all grade spans (K-12). As a result, staff report this content area is at Stage 4: Full Implementation.  Five years ago, the District adopted content-aligned Mathematics materials.  As a result, staff report this content area is at Stage 4: Full Implementation.  Grades K-8 began work on learning and providing instruction on the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  Other grade levels throughout the District are just starting their journey.  As such, knowledge levels are at Stage 1: Research and Investigation for grades 9-12, while grades K-8 are beginning Stage 2: Initial Implementation.  With the release of a new History-Social Studies Framework, all grade levels continue to be at Stage 1: Research and Investigation for History-Social Science.  However, adopted textbooks are in alignment with current History-Social Science standards.  Career and Technical Education (CTE) has been a focus at all comprehensive high schools for the past several years.  The District has 26 CTE pathways in ten industry sectors  including; Arts, Media and Entertainment, Information and Communication Technologies, and Manufacturing, and this year, a newly added Teacher pathway.  These programs have garnered tremendous momentum due to multiple million dollar plus CTE grants that have been awarded to the District..  Overall, staff rate the programs at Stage 3: Substantial Implementation. Furthermore, results from the self-analysis tool rate Health Education,  Physical education, Visual and Performing Arts, and World Language all at Stage 4: Full Implementation.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-08||Met|2019

54720580000000|Pleasant View Elementary|2|Pleasant View Elementary School District has chosen the following as our local measures to gauge the academic development of our students. These measures will be looked at annually and included in our local LCAP metrics or used in the needs assessment of the district when it comes to planning actions and services. Parent/Guardian Input Measure: • 100% of our students had access to common core aligned instructional materials in Reading/Language Arts and Math. • 92% of students K-5th were working on grade level material on Lexia; an online reading skills adaptive based reading program. That compares to 90% of students last year were working on grade level material. • 56% of 6th-8th grade students were working on grade level material on Reading Plus and adaptive based reading program. That compares to 54% of students last year were working on grade level material. • 18% of our students scored Standard Met in Reading Language Arts on the SBAC. Whereas a year ago 16% of our students scored at the Standard Met Level. 15% of our students scored Standard Met in Mathematics on the SBAC. Whereas a year ago 12% scored at the Standard Met Level. The district will continue to look at ways to improve Reading Language Arts and Math core instruction. • 7% of our ELD students scored Standard Met in Reading Language Arts on the SBAC. Whereas a year ago 8% of our students scored at the Standard Met Level. 8% of our ELD students scored Standard Met in Mathematics on the SBAC. Whereas a year ago 8.5% scored at the Standard Met Level. The district will continue to look at ways to improve Reading Language Arts and Math core instruction for our English Learner Students. • 6% of ELD students were re-classified English Proficient. This met our goal of 3% • 57% of students 2nd-8th grade scored at Grade Level on STAR Reading Assessments. Whereas a year ago 46% of students scored at Grade Level. • 48% of 7th and 8th grade students scored at Grade Level on the STAR Math Assessments. Whereas a year ago 47% scored at Grade level. The NWEA MAP assessment is given 3 times a year and the following was our year to year growth. In Reading K-8th 7/9 grade levels met growth target. In Language Use 3rd-8th 4/6 grade levels met growth target. In Math K-8th 8/9 grade levels met growth target. On the CAASPP our 3rd graders scored 33% standard met in ELA, 2019 up from 12% in 2017. Our 3rd graders scored 37% standard met in Math, 2019 up from 22% in 2017. We believe this signals a foundational shift in our primary grade levels TK- 3. Our students are demonstrating a stronger foundation of academic skills. The measures have been established in our LCAP in Goal 2 and are present in our actions and services within this goal. Pleasant View recognizes the ongoing need to continually reflect and make changes to how we measure the progress of our students. As Pleasant View will continue to look at new ways to measure the growth of our students, and align our actions and services accordingly.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-11-12||Met|2019

58727440000000|Plumas Lake Elementary|2|PLESD administration has developed a staff development and curriculum adoption plan for the new State standards. The PLESD staff have been included in the process through curriculum adoption committees, leadership committees, and surveys of needs in these areas. The PLESD School Board is updated on the progress of this plan during monthly board meetings. During the 2016-17 school year, the District convened a District ELA Curriculum adoption committee that evaluated, piloted, and chose a new ELA curriculum for both K-5 and 6-8 grades. Starting in 2015, the District began Academic Writing training and teachers were coached on how to implement the strategies. In 2016-17 the training was expanded to include all district kindergarten through fifth grade teachers and continued throughout the 2017-18 school year. PLESD has implemented an ELD curriculum and program for multiple years that is seeing excellent success. The majority of our students are reclassified as English Language Proficient before entering middle school. A new mathematics curriculum was implemented in 2016-17 in all grade levels. Previously, PLESD developed and used a common core scope and sequence to address the shifts of common core while awaiting the development of new math curriculums. Teachers received a tremendous amount of training and curriculum development in the area of math during the last three years. Next Generation Science Standards were fully implemented in 6th grade during the 2016-17 school year. During the 2017-18 school year 7th grade was fully implemented and in 2018-19 8th grade was implemented. Staff development and planning has occurred for all 6-8th grade teachers on the the new standards. The K-5th grade classrooms are in the beginning stages of implementation. PLESD has implemented an art and music program TK-8th grade including elementary art and music teachers, middle school band, and middle school art electives including an advanced art course. All students receive physical education taught by credentialed physical education teachers.

Over the course of the last three years a strong emphasis has been placed on building capacity for teacher leadership and ongoing professional development by developing "in-house" leadership teams in all of the curricular areas.  As a result of this we are seeing strong alignment in K-5 for Reading/Literacy and K-8 for Mathematics, Physical Education, Visual and Performing Arts and our Foreign Language program.  Strides have been made this year in further aligning the 6-8 Reading/Language Arts curriculum to the K-5 program.  The District recently completed a K-8 History/Social Studies adoption that is aligned with the new framework.   In the area of Science the curriculum adopted for 6-8 is fully implemented and we are currently piloting programs for adoption in the K-5.   The District consistently trains teachers who are working with English Language Learners in strategies and best practices to support students in the general program.  We are committed to teacher professional development and each year survey teachers to determine their priorities for district-wide professional development.

The content areas have benchmarks that are utilized to assess students’ progress at least three times a year. Specific examples of such assessments are Aimsweb fluency, EveryDay Math Benchmark tests, Accelerated Reader, Basic Phonics Skills Test, and Wonders Unit Assessment tests.    RSD is in the third year of the English Language Arts adoption of Wonders. During the 17/18 all staff received training in regard to the new program. In addition, grades 3-5 standards mapped and paced the curriculum. Kindergarten through second took part in the California Reading Literacy Project in regard to effective reading instruction. In regard to math, grade levels reviewed common assessments and shared agreements. History has been adopted in Tk-8th grade. Tk-5 adopted Studies Weekly and 6-8 adopted National Geographic. The 19/20 school year will have a cohort of teachers piloting three staff chosen publishers in the subject area of Next Generation Science Standards.  In 17/18 all middle school science teachers received training in regard to the Health Education Standards via Planned Parenthood.

English Learners (ELs) receive 30 minutes (grades K-2) or 45 minutes (grades 3-8) daily instruction in ELD, differentiated by their level of proficiency in English as measured by the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) and formative assessments. Teachers provide differentiated scaffolding, which is a teaching approach that progressively moves students who are at various proficiency and grade levels towards stronger understanding, skill acquisition, and learning. Teachers also provide integrated ELD throughout the rest of the school day to ensure that ELs have access to the core curriculum.     Richmond College Prep has a week of professional development prior to the start of the school year. Staff members receive curriculum and program trainings, collaborate within grade-level teams to do long-term planning for the school year, and prepare classrooms for the first day of school. During the school year, the staff meets once a month to discuss various academic and school climate issues. The professional development focus for the 2019-2020 school year is for teachers to learn the instructional methods contained in Lucy Calkins’ Reader's Workshop and Writer’s Workshop. Our Lower Elementary Director works with grade-level groups to study various aspects of the Reader's Workshop model, in which teachers get to observe, practice, and then implement units of study in their own classrooms. Grade-level teams also collaborate weekly on data analysis, instructional planning, and the needs of student subgroups, including English Learners. Teachers receive weekly one-on-one instructional coaching from their Director and also participate in grade-level planning.   Teachers also receive three days of professional development annually, which include dedicated days for understanding and implementing CA CCSS and ELD standards, developing instructional strategies for supporting English Learners and other subgroups of students. Teachers receive ongoing coaching from consultants and Directors in all subject areas.     There are regular meetings of the Professional Learning Communities--groups of educators that meet regularly, share expertise, and work collaboratively to improve teaching skills and the academic performance of students.|5|4|5|4|4|5|5|5|4|4|5|4|5|4|4|3|4|4|4|1|5|5|4|2019-10-29||Met|2019

We seek out and offer a variety of standards-based curricular supports.  Focus is given to core content for classes in math, language arts, science and social studies for grades 6 – 12.  We produce and maintain course descriptions and syllabi and administer end-of-course testing to ensure content mastery.  Our students participate in normed growth projection testing twice per school year, at the beginning of each semester.  The NWEA MAP testing gives our teachers and parents actionable data to determine student needs and subsequently address those needs with standards-based instruction.   The data from the NWEA MAP test is analyzed by staff to monitor growth of both grade-level groups and individual students through the use of focal groups and intervention rosters.  Student goals are set based on these findings, and individual plans are enacted using the Response to Intervention protocol. As a school offering individualized learning opportunities, RVCS ensures both adopted standards-based curriculum and a broad array of options for coursework support these standards.  Throughout the semester, the teacher and school leadership conduct progress monitoring using Exact Path, Study Island and/or other individualized programs. Teachers work to align instruction with Common Core standards using specified support materials and programs.  We are working to implement Common Core standards through new materials and learning activities from local resources. These integrate students with their communities in preparation toward good citizenship.  Some resources include concurrent community college enrollment, volunteer opportunities and service projects, homeschool co-operatives, library workshops and local parks and recreation agencies classes.  We offer access to supplemental coursework through online programs that are aligned to Common Core Standards such as Edmentum programs, Discovery Education, and Khan Academy.   All teachers hold California Teaching credentials and participate in ongoing professional development throughout the school year.  The staff meets monthly for professional development, and there are web-based modules designed to familiarize the teachers with various opportunities for the student, such as the Edmentum programs.

Classroom visit data collection is documented with the DigiCoach data collection tool. The DigiCoach data was selected, because it quantifies observed implementation/teaching of academic standards. There were 3,302 documented classroom visits during the 2018-19 school year.  Additionally, the District has weekly Professional Learning Community (PLC) teacher collaboration time built into the schedule. Site administrators join the weekly PLC sessions to engage in anecdotal data collection of academic standards implementation, as well as analysis of student performance data on local and state assessments.  Professional learning in support of teacher implementation of academic standards is available. Two instructional coaches were available for the full 2018-19 school year and three instructional coaches were available for half the year to support teachers through one-one-one, small group, and large group sessions. Session calendars are managed digitally and quantified to identify support service time provided to teachers. In addition to instructional coaches, professional learning opportunities are offered through: whole group sessions, consultant support, and school-site professional learning sessions. All sessions are managed in a district online management system to quantify hours/time and participants. The online management system also collects session evaluation data. The data is analyzed throughout the year to inform professional learning session planning and delivery.   Finally, a 30-hour Orton-Gillingham instructional methods workshop was offered to teachers in summer 2019. Orton-Gillingham methods are literacy instructional methods to support students who exhibit the traits of dyslexia or have difficulty with reading skills.

Common formative assessments and interim assessments are used as our metric to track the implementation and progress of the standards at each school and in each classroom.  School Leadership Teams and District Leadership Teams analyze the data on a regular basis and provide feedback through the cycle of inquiry. We chose this metric to ensure our district and school sites are making evidence (data) driven decisions that are directly aligned to the ELA and Math standards, targets and claims.  The interim assessments are particularly important as there is a high correlation to the smarter balanced assessment.   A) ELA: After analyzing evidence (data) from all schools in our district, we have identified that our students are making continuous progress towards meeting or exceeding the standards indicating that our staff and students are in full implementation (5) of the new California ELA standards. Evidence includes: newly adopted aligned curriculum, Professional Development on new curriculum implementation, systematic common and interim assessments being used district-wide to monitor mastery of standards, and teaching teams developing well-planned lessons with clear evidence of learning and success criteria. Our goal is to continue to have teachers work fluently with the ELA standards and have students continue to take ownership of their learning targets and progress toward mastery.  B) Math: After analyzing evidence (data) from all schools in our district, we have identified that our students are making continuous progress towards meeting or exceeding the standards indicating that our staff and students are in full implementation (5) of the new California Math standards. Our teachers have well-planned units and aligned curriculum. They have formative and summative assessments to monitor individual student progress toward mastery and their students engage in mathematical practices (creating models, using precision, communicating their understanding).

The District has provided both professional learning and materials to prepare teachers to provide instruction to students in the State Standards.  In the fall of 2015, the Rosemead School District piloted materials aligned to the new Mathematics Standards and began full implementation during the 2016-17 school year supported with professional learning. In the spring of 2017, teachers piloted materials aligned to the ELA standards and we selected the Wonders curriculum based on teachers and stakeholder input. Embedded in that curricular adoption are materials aligned to the new ELD standards as well. Teachers have received professional learning and classroom coaching in the implementation of the ELD standards aligned to the State ELA standards.  Last school year, the Rosemead School District has identified the Next Generation Science Standards as the area of focus for professional learning and is working closely with the Los Angeles County Office of Education to provide four days of professional learning in NGSS and STEAM. Following the professional learning and examination and research of the new California Science Test (CAST), we plan to research and pilot materials this year that will best support the teaching of the NGSS and STEM.  Classroom walkthroughs are a strategy that the District has used in improving practices and has expanded that practice to include Instructional Rounds with all principals. Another area that we have identified as a next step is the refining of our collaborative practices during our Late Start Wednesdays.  Rosemead School District Instructional Leadership Team used the state reflection tool as well as the ELA and Math Implementation Rubrics from Butt County Office of Education (shared in the Local Indicator Handbook) to measure growth in this priority area because we found those to be conducive to collaborative and reflective conversations focused on continuous improvement.|5|5|5|3|3|5|5|5|3|3|4|4|4|3|3|3|4|3|4|3|4|4|4|2019-10-17|The Rosemead School District is committed to providing professional development to promote ongoing learning to support high quality, rigorous instruction in all content areas.  For the past three years, the district has offered between 6-8 professional development days to build the capacity of our teachers and staff.  At each site, every other Wednesday is used for teacher and staff professional learning and collaboration.  Support and training is provided for teachers and support staff to provide intervention services for struggling students. Teachers also have weekly collaboration time to collaboratively plan, share best practices, create common assessments, and monitor student progress.  All TK-8 teachers participate in Data Spotlight/Reflection Sessions with their principal to discuss and reflect upon best instructional practices based on assessment data.|Met|2019

Teachers work as a Professional Learning Community on a weekly basis, and the teachers collectively determine areas of improvement and select professional learning needs.  Teachers referenced the LCFF reflection tool provided, and opted to complete this narrative summary, as it allows us to more clearly describe our progress and next steps.  Santa Barbara Charter School continues to provide professional development opportunities for teachers and other staff with the Common Core State Standards in Math and English Language Arts, with full implementation and sustainability.  During 2018-19, we focused on CCSS mathematics, specifically:  -Focus on the school-wide chosen Mathematical Practices MP3: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others  -Develop school-wide systems and practices, specifically developing Mathematical Routines, in order to help students make sense of mathematics, develop convincing mathematical arguments, and critique and build onto others’ reasoning. -Teachers in the HomeBased Partnership continued working with families of identified students to improve their CCSS math curriculum delivery to develop students’ standards-aligned mathematical fluency.    As the History and Social Science standards were released more recently, we are in the beginning phases of development and in the exploration phase of curriculum alignment.  In the 2019-20 school year we will be focusing on elements of the History and Social Science Standards, specifically linking them to Project Based Learning.  The NGSS standards are implemented consistently across the grade levels, as measured by teacher reports and administrative walk-throughs. We are in the initial implementation phase of staff development regarding ELD.  During 2018/19, we continued with our re-visioned PE program as our new specialist implemented a program that addresses grade-specific standards in a more systematic manner.

42767860000000|Santa Barbara Unified|2|SBUnified continues to use a modified version of the state adopted reflection tool to assess progress in implementing the standards to allow for local adaptations. The guiding principles have been: 1) understand the instructional shifts embedded within standards, 2) gain a deep understanding of the cognitive rigor and depth of knowledge associated with standards, and 3) understand the design of standards, in particular the “spiraling” nature of learning across grade spans.  Our implementation of the state content standards reflects the state’s multi-year adoption of revised standards. In 2018-2019, three improvements supported implementation of standards in most content areas. First, the refined districtwide instructional focus states that, “Students demonstrate the ability to read, reason, and communicate in order to contribute positively to an ever-changing world.” Second, we re-designed the TOSA role to Instructional Support Specialists (ISSs) in the four core content areas to deepen implementation of the standards and effectively integrate instructional technology. Third, we continued to curate instructional materials aligned to the standards that afford teachers flexibility to customize content to meet the rigor and demands of the standards as well as the needs of our students, and identified needs for formal adoption.  Increased content-specific support for standards implementation included several actions. We onboarded six literacy coaches in elementary and a second ELD TOSA in secondary. Professional learning in math attends to newly adopted curriculum in secondary, and an Illustrative Math Alpha pilot in elementary. We continue to implement the CCSS-aligned Full Option Science Sequence in K-5, and Ocean Science Sequence in grade 6, and teachers grades 7-12 continue developing units of study with common learning experiences. In social science, teachers continue with inquiry- and project-based curricula which include broad utilization of open educational resources (OERs) and implementation of the Fair Act (2011). Teachers in physical education, health, VAPA, CTE and world languages also continue to practice standards-based instruction aligned to state adoptions.  With regard to supporting staff in identifying where they can improve instruction, we are refining use of collaboration time for teachers teams to engage in cycles of inquiry across content areas; this includes developing common formative assessments, analyzing student work, and identifying needed shifts in instruction to support student learning.

An Interim Comprehensive Assessment gauges student progress towards achieving standards in math and literacy across content areas.  Additional common assessments, curated or created by subject-area representatives, are administered in several departments.   ELA Common Core, standards-based units and common assessments have been developed and implemented across all four years of ELA.  A consultant used the state standards rubric to work with teachers in creating and reviewing the common units and revising where needed.   ELD teachers completed common core aligned units and are undergoing the revision process.  In addition, the District has provided “Constructing Meaning” training from EL Achieve for district-wide implementation of Integrated ELD strategies.   Math Common Core-aligned textbooks have been chosen for all Common Core courses.  Common assessments are administered to track student progress.    Next Generation Science Standards developed and implemented NGSS units across disciplines.  A district TOSA has led training available to all teachers to align instructional practices with NGSS.  Biology and chemistry teachers have participated in in-depth professional development and curriculum planning.  Physics teachers will participate in spring, 2020. History-Social Science: Social Studies teachers adopted CCSS-aligned textbooks in spring 2019.  The ICA will assess literacy standards for history and social science.   CTE courses were all re-written to align to the 2013 state CTE standards.  The adoption tool was developed from the CTE pathway standards. Health Ed. Content Standards is a quarter-long living skills class during which most of the Health Education Content Standards are covered.  The District’s Health Ed.

The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and our Schoolwide Learning Objectives (SLOs) serve as the foundation for all curricular offerings at SRCHS. All courses are aligned to the CCSS and California State Standards, with most courses falling in the “full implementation” category, leaving room for to grow into “full implementation and sustainability.”  The staff has been successful in increasing the rigor and expectations of the curricula, providing scaffolding where needed for success.  As all of our students participate in these rigorous, relevant, and coherent standards-based curricula, our courses contain Differentiated Instruction to make the course accessible at all levels.  This is evidenced through the academic-based LCAP Goal #1.  The continuation of infusing Differentiated Instruction and Universal Design for Learning into lesson planning and courses of study provides additional focus on implementation of CCSS and California State Standards within the curriculum.  This process allows staff the opportunity not only to ensure alignment of curriculum to the CCSS and California State Standards, but also to identify and implement effective instructional strategies and practices.    To assess our students on mastery of CCSS and California State Standards, our school’s and district’s  PIR and LCAP both include increased use of the CAASPP interim assessments as formative assessments.|Met|2019

Through the planning process, teachers gain greater understanding of the Common Core and are able to guide students to proficiency more fluidly. The work that students do as part of the common assessment plan is more authentic to real world skills, enabling them to better meet Common Core proficiency. Teachers have set aside time to become familiar with the parts of the assessment plan, as well as time each week dedicated to improving the projects and content assessment for their students and building enrichment into the curriculum.

Our Standardized Assessment Program is a schedule of externally validated assessments thoughtfully laid out and scheduled throughout the year that include pre-assessments, mid-year formative assessments, and summative post-assessments. These assessments are used as measures by the LEA of progress on the Common Core Standards because they provide evidence and feedback on a variety of topics especially literacy and numeracy. Assessments planned include the following (this list is not exhaustive): SBAC interim assessments (both the comprehensive assessment- ICAs and the block assessments- IABs); NWEA MAP a math and reading tests used for pre-assessment of 6th- 10th graders, mid-year assessment and end of the tear assessment and as part of English Language Development/Learner proficiency; PSATs; SATs and ACTs. Additionally, we use data and information from our coaching and induction programming to inform teacher performance in their adoption and implementation of standards.

Assessments planned include the following (this list is not exhaustive): SBAC interim assessments (both the comprehensive assessment- ICAs and the block assessments- IABs); NWEA MAP a math and reading tests used for pre-assessment of 6th- 10th graders, mid-year assessment and end of the tear assessment and as part of English Language Development/Learner proficiency; PSATs; SATs and ACTs. Additionally, we use data and information from our coaching and induction programming to inform teacher performance in their adoption and implementation of standards. At Summit Shasta each teacher receives weekly coaching and has time for professional development every 6-8 weeks where coaches and coachees review lesson plans and student performance data and use identified look fors and standards aligned to best teaching practices for implementation of the curriculum. Beginning teachers at Summit Shasta are also involved in an induction program and are evaluated for their cleared credentialed based upon their ability to implement the standards.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-06-20||Met|2019
43104390123794|Summit Public School: Tahoma|2|At Summit Tahoma we have designed our curriculum and student experience to align with common core and state standards. Summit Public Schools provides all schools in the Summit Public Schools network with a base curriculum. This curriculum includes Common Core aligned projects and content assessments that teachers collaboratively plan, edit, execute and provide feedback on. Through the planning process, teachers gain greater understanding of the Common Core and are able to guide students to proficiency more fluidly. The work that students do as part of the common assessment plan is more authentic to real world skills, enabling them to better meet Common Core proficiency. Teachers have set aside time to become familiar with the parts of the assessment plan, as well as time each week dedicated to improving the projects and content assessment for their students and building enrichment into the curriculum. Teachers also have dedicated days of professional development around assessment calibration, and long-term curriculum planning.

In addition, teachers use curriculum embedded assessments to monitor students' mastery of standards. For students who o not demonstrate proficiency, students are given adaptive and prescriptive assessments and interventions using Moby Max and Ascend Math. In order to best serve our English Language Learners, the ELPAC assessment is used along with the Language Assessment on the NWEA MAP to identify students' academic needs . The Rosetta Stone software is used as an adaptive and prescriptive measure of intervention to assist our students with individualized acquisition of the English Language. The state Physical Fitness Test results are used to determine the overall fitness of our students, and TCA is using the Fitness Gram software to preassess and monitor the students health goals throughout the school year.|3|2|3|3|3|5|5|5|5|5|3|3|3|3|3|2|2|4|3|1|4|3|3|2019-05-13||Met|2019

33103300136168|Temecula International Academy|2|TIA is continuing to work towards developing and adhering to a rigorous school curriculum in relation to Foundational World Language instruction & implementation of Common Core State Standards (CCSS). TIA utilizes iReady and CAASPP data to plan and guide curriculum delivery and assessment procedures that are aligned to LCAP goals. Professional development will consist of developing Professional Learning Communities among the faculty/staff to align curriculum standards, assessments, and data conversations to ensure the alignment of these school elements. The iReady diagnostic provides benchmark assessment data that will be used to drive instruction and assist teachers in the development of personalized learning environments. Formative/summative assessments identify student’s understanding and application of content skills as they relate to the CCSS. CAASPP standardized test results provides a cumulative evaluation of student’s academic knowledge and understanding.  The above assessment tools  will inform and clarify the academic progress of students and student sub-groups. In addition, the adoption of standards based report cards will continue to assist teachers in developing their understanding of how the CCSS are being addressed in relation to assessment strategies, classroom activities, and various instructional practices.   TIA has adopted curriculum that supports the standards adopted by the State Board of Education. The school has developed a strong core curriculum (Mathematics, English Language Arts, Science, History-Social Science, and World Language). The ELD standards are being addressed as of the 2019-2020 school year in relation to students who have been assessed according to the ELPAC. Work will take place during weekly faculty/staff meetings during PLC time to assist in helping teachers build their capacity in the ELD standards that will translate into specific class instruction that supports ELA lessons and activities. The Physical Education Content Model Content Standards are being addressed through regularly scheduled PE class. The Visual Arts standards are being addressed consistently; however, the performing arts standards are implemented on a minimal level due to lack of resources.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|||Met|2019

19650600000000|Torrance Unified|2|TUSD continues its commitment to the Implementation of State Academic Standards. A variety of measurements are utilized to monitor progress of standards-driven professional development, and standards-aligned instruction. Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) that are inclusive of regular school-wide, grade-level, and subject area team collaboration on a weekly basis at every school site establish cycles for instructing within essential standards, and evaluating student progress toward those benchmarks using Common Formative Assessments (CFA’s). The individual teacher CFA results demonstrating implementation by the student, by the standard, are an integral part of the on-going PLC cycle for all teachers, subject areas and grade levels, and further ensure that state standards are implemented with fidelity.  Additionally, all 30 TUSD schools monitor the progress of school-level implementation by establishing a related goal in the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). Teachers in all grade levels have attended district-led professional development efforts and workshops for all content areas. All trainings include a component of planning and implementation prep time, as well as follow up and coaching/observation opportunities for participating teachers with district instructional training staff and specialists. All workshops and trainings include mandatory post-event surveys and participating teachers are required to rate the experience for “potential positive impact on their teaching” using a Likert Scale rating. At least 95% of survey respondents continue to rate their experience at a level 4 out of 5 or higher, affirming the positive impact of the standards-driven professional learning and its alignment to classroom instruction.  Finally, TUSD continues its progress in implementing the SBE adopted standards for all areas, including: English Language Arts, English Language Development, Mathematics, Next Generation Science Standards, History-Social Science, Career Technical Education, Health Education content standards, Physical Education model content standards, Visual and Performing Arts, and World Languages. Collectively and individually, all TUSD teachers representing the areas listed above have participated in weekly collaboration as well as professional development to unpack and investigate changes in their standards, as well as to create and adjust plans for implementation and instruction. All content areas are closely overseen by site administrators, as well as by the two Directors of Curriculum.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-21||Met|2019

In elementary schools, all areas were at a 4 or above except English Language Development (3.9) and NGSS Science (3.8).  Our English learners continue to make strong progress, and we believe the rating just below full implementation is due to most ELD instruction being provided as designated ELD instruction from Intervention Specialists although the rating came from all teachers.  NGSS Science has moved up one point per year, and all elementary teachers had a full day of science standards and instructional materials training at the beginning of this school year and are implementing new NGSS-aligned instructional materials.  In our secondary schools, teachers rated all areas at full implementation except English Language Development in middle school (again provided as designated ELD by a two teachers), high school world language, where new standards were released in January, 2019 and have not been fully implemented yet, and NGSS Science, where teachers are continuing to work on full alignment.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-08||Met|2019
23656156117386|Tree of Life Charter|2|As a Montessori charter school, Tree of Life staff strive to ensure that the Montessori curriculum that is the foundation for instruction is also aligned with the State's adopted academic standards.  Their main tool for this is Montessori Compass, which is an online record keeping tool that also shows the alignment of Montessori lessons with Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards.  Staff record each student's progress in learning the content and skills presented in the Montessori lessons and required by the State.  Because Montessori history follows a sequential timeline, it differs from the State in introducing ancient civilizations before U.S. History, but the full sequence required by the State is completed by the end of sixth grade year.  Records are reviewed at the end of each semester by staff, students, and parents as part of monitoring the progress of the student and providing extra support whenever necessary.    Additionally, staff continued to learn how to improve their instruction by attending workshops, seminars, and webinars.  This year, staff attended seminars on the Love and Logic approach to teaching and "Effectively Dealing with Disruptive Students."  One staff member attended a webinar on "Addressing Challenging Behaviors in the Montessori Elementary Classroom", then shared it with the rest of the staff.  One of the teachers completed the Montessori coursework and another took a NASA STEAM training on astronomy.  The staff conducted an LEA self-assessment and FIT (Fidelity Implementation Tool) school self-assessment through its association with the SUMS (Scaling Up Multi-Tiered Systems of Support) programs and SWIFT Education Center.  A second on-site assessment by a third party from SWIFT was also performed, and staff received feedback and resources for continuing their work to scale up MTSS.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-30||Met|2019
45699140135624|Tree of Life International Charter|2|The school established schoolwide SMART GOALS for the 2018-19 schoolyear in August, 2018 in the areas of Foundational Reading in English and Spanish; Mathematics; Reading and Comprehension; Listening and Speaking; Writing; and ELD. Each area has a designated assessment that is used to measure benchmark progress on the SMART GOAL, culminating in the CAASPP for ELA and Math; and the Calif Science Assessment for 5th grade; and the California Spanish Assessment that was just implemented for the first time in spring 2019 and scores are still to be released.  The school has now set rigorous schoolwide SMART GOALS for the 2019-20 in all of the same areas and is engaging in a cycle of instruction and data collection, analysis and reflection as they progress monitor regularly.  The local measures used to indicate progress toward the goals, and the grade levels meeting or exceeding the goals in 2018-19 were the following: The Spanish Phonics Screener: Grades K, 1, 2.   DRA in Spanish: Grades 1, 2, 5.  BPST in English: Grades 1-4 did not meet goal.  Fountas and Pinnell in English: Grades 2 and 4 met or exceeded goals.  For Math we use the Bridges Summative assessments as well as the Eureka Math Module assessments: Criteria was met in all Grades except 3, 4. In October, 2019 we will begin the use of the iReady online Diagnostic assessments for grades 2-6 in ELA and Math to provide detailed data to teachers on student mastery of the standards and provide information on student grouping for intervention.   Additionally, in October we will begin piloting NGSS Curriculum in grades 2-6 with the TWIG NGSS curriculum. We hope to make a decision on which program to adopt by the end of the school year 2019-20.  History and Social Science is taught through imbedded curriculum in the Benchmarks Adelante Language Arts Program in grades K-2, and through the Houghton Mifflin Social Studies program in grades 3-5. As currently a K-6 school, we have not established a Career Technical Education plan, however, we plan to add this as we move into grades 7 and 8 in the next 3 years.  Health Education Content Standards are taught implicitly and imbedded in our program through physical ed and health class. All 5th grade students participate in the state Physical Education assessment in Spring of 5th grade. In 2018-19, 95% of Tree of Life International 5th graders met or exceeded the PE goals. All students participate in a robust Visual and Performing Arts Program which includes World Music and Dance, and Multicultural Art with several performances annually. As a Dual Immersion School, all students are receiving 90% of their instruction in Spanish at Grades TK-3rd, and 50% at grades 4-6. In Addition, students are introduced to multiple languages and cultures through the World Music and Dance program, and through regular classes in Karate, taught in Japanese, and French.  All 5th and 6th graders have a daily 3rd language elective class in either French or American Sign Language.|5|4|5|4|3|5|5|5|4|3|5|4|5|4|3|3|4|4|5|5|5|5|4|2019-10-22|In order to focus on the ongoing professional development of all teachers in the CCSS, we have a Leadership Team that meets weekly to set the agenda for PD and collaboration, and review schoolwide data. Every Wed the teachers meet for 3 hours for PD and collaboration around the CCSS, review student work and set SMART GOALS. The school provides 8 days of preservice training each year for all certificated teachers, and 2 non-student days during the school year with a specific PD focus.|Met|2019

We also saw a 10% gain in our socioeconomically disadvantaged student participation rate. TRHS uses multiple measures of assessment and teacher/student/parent collaboration to identify the needs of students and to track overall student performance and growth as a Personalized Learning Independent Study Charter school. The Renaissance assessments for language arts and mathematics are administered to 3rd-8th grade students in the fall and spring each year to identify areas of needed support and growth. We chose this tool because we have used it for years and have confidence in the validity of the assessments. Teachers and parents are able to use the reports to effectively identify student areas of need and set goals toward academic success in meeting the state grade level standards. In addition; teachers, students and parents meet every 20 school days to review student assignments, reflect on effectiveness of curriculum and to collaborate on providing students with educational support and materials to meet the needs of all students. When additional areas of need are identified teachers collaborate to support one another in implementing academic standards to bring up student performance. Teachers also receive support from educational support staff, and when applicable, conduct Student Success Team meetings to provide additional support and resources for students. As a personalized learning Independent Study Charter School, Twin Ridges Home Study students have the unique opportunity to explore fields of study related to career technical education, athletics and visual and performing arts and world languages as a part of their homeschool curriculum or personal pursuits.

10621660114553|University High|2|UHS has chosen to use the SBAC tests to track the progress of our students. We feel this assessment provides significant summative data that tells us how our students are performing compared to students in other schools. Additionally, UHS uses internal benchmarks to help us track individual student progress through our math curriculum to ensure our school has a successful articulated curriculum. In areas outside of math and English, UHS uses different metrics to determine success. With the Next Generation Science Standards, our school expects students to take and complete 5 different (A-G approved) science courses over their 4-year program, including 3 college level science classes. We also ensure social science, Visual and Performing Arts and World Language competency by requiring ALL students to take and pass 3 years of A-G approved social science, 4 years of A-G approved Visual and Performing Class and 3 years of a language other than English.  Expectations for all of these classes exceed any state requirements. Lastly with PE, UHS uses State PFT scores of freshmen. Because all UHS students must complete an A-G college prep curriculum to earn a high school diploma, we do not separately measure CTE enrollment.  Progress by the students has been terrific. • In 2019, 98% and 88% of our junior students either met or exceeded the standard on English and Math, respectively  • In 2018, 69% of freshmen reached 6 out of 6 performance standards • With A-G completion rates that we use to measure science, visual and performing arts, World Language and social science, we expect 75% of our students to complete A-G requirements (meaning they must earn a grade of C or better) with a graduation rate of 95% or above. The graduating class of 2019 achieved this target with 98%, or 117 out of 119 students completing their A-G requirements with all C or better grades.

This is reinforced with the LCAP and WASC school action plans.  Sources used to identify training and materials needs are as follows: (1) individualized annual planning meetings with faculty and administration; (2) faculty experience and competency in curriculum/instruction/assessment practices as measured by classroom observations and evaluation cycles; (3) student performance and achievement data; (4) frequency of professional learning experiences, opportunity to stay current; (5) faculty questionnaire; and, (6) master schedule course assignments. Administration works with Department Chairs and individual faculty to prioritize resources and professional learning needs. Weekly collaboration time is embedded within the school calendar; these meetings are dedicated to grade-level professional learning teams, staff meetings, department collaboration, and schoolwide planning.  Three Staff Development Days are allocated within the school calendar for professional learning and collaboration purposes.  A summer training is provided to support staff in keeping current with new and evolving technologies.  Areas of emphasis for additional outside training are math and science practices, vertical alignment of curricula, new publisher adoptions, College Board (Pre-AP and AP), social-emotional development, and college/career readiness trainings.|Met|2019

01100170125567|Urban Montessori Charter|2|Because we are a Montessori school, UMCS uses an American Montessori Society and Association Montessori Internationale curriculum alignment map when aligning our scope and sequence with the CA standards. We reference other public Montessori curricular maps if needed. Lessons are given individually or in small groups to meet the needs of students. Children are given the opportunity to express their learning through various outputs that reflect choice, learning style, and developmental level. Teachers evaluate student work and provide feedback that guides their progress. Standards-aligned Progress Reports classroom lesson reports are shared three times a year with families so they have an understanding of lessons presented, work completed, and growth tracked.   Students use a work plan or journal to plan, track, and reflect on their work throughout the school day, week, and year. Regular meetings with teachers support a heightened awareness and personalized look at a student’s own focus, work, and patterns of learning. If a child is in need of more support, we meet with families to develop and use targeted interventions in eight-week increments to monitor student progress. Interventions include a variety of in-classroom best practices as well as accessing specialists’ support for intensive intervention. Students have access to services such as special reading groups, occupational therapy, and speech and language. Teachers continue interventions that result in measurable growth.  Our students show evidence of opportunity gaps. We support teachers to approach their classrooms with an equity lens, working to provide an education that allows every child to reach their full potential. We observe in classrooms to highlight ways that we can support teachers to identify patterns, blind spots, and ways they can better serve our students. We practice structured data analysis to coach and support teachers in tightening their feedback loop as well as gain a better understanding of what pieces of the curriculum students are accessing or not. We are examining our math sequence and presentation styles to look for ways in which they may serve as barriers to student understanding and are looking critically at systems or platforms we’ve adopted to see if they actually take away from fidelity of implementation of our Montessori pedagogy.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-24|We are focusing on the fidelity of our Montessori pedagogy to accelerate our understanding of where students need more support and ensure that students have access to content.

33752420000000|Val Verde Unified|2|Val Verde has continued to implement the CCSS and NGSS with the belief that those closest to the work should be leading the work. To ensure this, teachers in Val Verde are given a myriad of opportunities to lead and become involved. Val Verde has 3 types of teacher leader teams that interact together to further implement the CCSS. These three teams are the Curriculum Council, the content area/grade level specific Common Core Implementation Teams (CCIT) and the Professional Learning Networks (PLNs). The Curriculum Council is a decision making body jointly ran by the Val Verde Teacher’s Association and Educational Services. The member body consists of teachers from every site ensuring equal representation. This Council meets several times a year to research, discuss and ultimately decide on issues concerning curriculum such as grading policies, approval of instructional materials and areas of concern sites bring up. The CCIT teacher leader teams are responsible for the development of comprehensive curriculum guides (Year Plans/Units of Study), and have created and utilized common assessments that align to subject specific CCSS standards to inform instruction through data team analysis. The CCIT teams are made up of teachers from every site and every grade level/subject. In addition to teachers leading the work of these teams, members may also include district leadership, site administrators and instructional coaches.  CCIT members are given release time several days a year for this purpose. The purpose of the PLN cohorts is to learn together, plan, and deliver the Professional Learning needed for CCSS Instruction, STEAM, Writing, Technology, ELPD etc. Each PLN consists of a cohort of teachers passionate about a particular educational topic or based on subject/grade level needs. Each PLN explores the cohort topic in depth on an ongoing basis alongside Ed Services.  These cohorts become the in-house resident experts on the topic and are then able to lead Professional Development for ALL teachers either at District Wide Professional Learning Days, Core days, Staff Meetings, Collaborative Coaching and Learning Observation cycles (CCLS), and/or department/grade level Meetings etc. Val Verde teachers continue to receive support through ongoing district-wide workshops, site-based instructional coaching, and grade level/content area professional learning communities. These multiple venues have been held both during the summer and throughout the school year. It has been through these countless opportunities for professional growth that teachers have been able to attend grade/subject level professional development and self-select sessions and workshops that meet their individual needs. Val Verde is founded upon the ideals of collaborative professionalism and teacher empowerment.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-05-07||Met|2019

19647330137612|Valley International Preparatory High|2|All students at VIPHS participate in a rigorous, standards-based instructional program.  Valley International Preparatory High School’s rigorous, college-preparatory curriculum was developed using the Common Core State Standards, with curricula, units, and lessons designed in a way that will foster critical thinking, communication skills, and help students make connections within and between key concepts embedded in the standards using the Key Cognitive Strategies.    In order to facilitate the use of both the Common Core standards and the Key Cognitive strategies in curriculum development, all instructional staff participated in departmental  professional development.  Departments worked together to do a “deep dive” into the standards for their discipline and to use the Key Cognitive Strategies to bring clarity to the myriad standards in different courses.  Teachers use the KCS to create a structure to organize the standards, communicate the standards to students, and provide a coherent language for teaching critical thinking and the learning process.  Once departments created their KCS charts in August, individual teachers were asked to include the KCS focus for each lesson on their weekly lesson plans.  By identifying a KCS focus for each lesson, teachers are able to indicate which specific skills students will be developing during that lesson.  Since the KCS charts were created using the CCSS, California State Standards, or NGSS standards, the indication of the KCS focus for each lesson includes the standards without having to use the overly-specific and sometimes cumbersome language of the state standards with students.  Since teachers have explicitly designed their content specific KCS charts to align with the state standards, we can see the standards embedded in each lesson through the use of the Key Cognitive Strategies.  Progress towards standards is measured with NWEA MAP Testing, Summative CAAASP Testing for juniors, A-G completion rates, and credit accumulation rates.|4|4|4|3|4|3|4|4|3|4|4|4|4|4|4|2|2|2|4|4|4|4|3|2019-10-15||Met|2019

56725205630405|Valley Oak Charter|2|Valley Oak Charter has adopted the following measures or tools that track its progress in implementing the state academic standards, followed by the reasons for their selection:  • Moby Max Diagnostics, iXL Analytics, Edgenuity Placement Assessments: Standards-based and computer adaptive, these assessments are administered in an ongoing manner to provide evidence of individual student progress and to monitor academic growth over time.  •Parent Survey: This survey collects input from our parent community regarding student progress in meeting standards and provides an opportunity for parents to reflect on their experience at VOC.  •Weekly Work Records: Written evidence of each student’s required educational engagement showing student completion of independent study assignments in the academics.   LCAP Standards: 60% or more of K-12 students will meet their grade level goals in ELA and Literacy, 50% in Math, as measured by Moby Max, Edgenuity, and iXL benchmark assessments. At least 90% of VOC students will complete 100% of their Independent Study assignments during the year (as measured by completed work records).   VOC’s progress in implementing academic standards, based on the above measures are as follows: 71% of VOC students met their grade level goals in ELA, Reading 70%, Math 59%, as measured by our local benchmark assessments. These results show the percent of students who either scored at grade level or showed growth: Language Arts 92%, Math 85%. In the 2018-19 VOC school-wide survey: 90% of parents reported that their child progressed satisfactorily in the academics. 96% of students reported that they were successfully learning the academic subjects. 99% of students completed 100% of their Independent Study Assignments.

However, parents are required to teach the State common core standards and assess their child’s academic progress using both CAASPP and local benchmark exams.  Recently, the school introduced a requirement that students use an online tracking system that tracks progress on the standards and remediates deficiencies. The school uses these assessments to identify low-performing students who are then offered after-school tutoring classes.  Parents work closely with the school’s certificated staff to create an individual learning plan (Goals & Objectives) that addresses the standards while allowing for the individual needs, interests, and abilities of the student. Progress on this plan is measured by weekly Work Records, which are evaluated by the Supervising Teachers.

39686270129916|Valley View Charter Prep|2|Valley View Charter Prep is committed to using educational data to drive instruction. To that end, we use NWEA MAP interim assessments for all 2nd-11th grade students in reading and mathematics. VVCP embraces NWEA’s MAP testing as our most important and effective assessment and monitoring system to determine student progress toward achievement of the academic standards and the Schoolwide Learner Outcomes. Students are assessed in reading and math bi-annually. The initial administration takes place in the first two weeks of the school year. After the data has been dis-aggregated, VVCP’ teachers engage in data dialogues to analyze student performance to verify placement in English and math courses. Results from this screener are incorporated into school ‘growth goals’ that are shared with our School Board.    Valley View Charter Prep works collectively to ensure that all students participate in a rigorous, relevant, and coherent standards-based curriculum that supports the achievement of the academic standards and the Schoolwide Learner Outcomes. VVCP implements and uses appropriate Common Core aligned curriculum along with standards based supplemental supports. VVCP offers multiple pathways for learning and for achieving the Schoolwide Learner Outcomes. We support our students in accessing the curriculum through a pathway that meets their individual learning needs, their post-graduation goals, and their interests.

15638420000000|Wasco Union Elementary|2|The Wasco Union Elementary School District conducts regular reviews of student academic growth. The data gathered for these reviews include formative assessments such as DIBELS, EL Assessments, Unit Assessments in the core curriculum, and administrative classroom walkthrough logs. Summative assessment results such as CAASPP, ELPAC, and other state-mandated measures are reported in the California School Dashboard and serve as a comprehensive measure of academic performance each school year.  The abovementioned data is available to all instructional staff through the use of student information databases.  Full access to these systems assists in the facilitation of collaboration across the district. Collaborative practices occur not just at each school site, but teachers in the district meet regularly grade level meetings across all schools in the district. This full articulation has helped establish consistent instructional practices, equitable intervention processes, and systematic instruction and assessment across all district classrooms. Each grade level, in turn, reports to a district administrator to facilitate prompt attention to the instructional needs of students.  Through collaboration, teacher leaders from across the district have gathered each of the last five school years to identify and adopt the latest Common Core State Adopted curriculum for each of the following subjects: Mathematics TK-8 – 2015 – Full Implementation English Language Arts TK-8 (Level 2) - 2016 – Full Implementation English Language Development TK-8 (Level 5) - 2017 – Full Implementation History/ Social Science K-8 - 2018 – Full Implementation NGSS Science K-8 – 2019 – Initial Implementation  Each year of a new adoption cycle, teachers and academic leaders in the district conduct summer work-study to develop lessons and assessments for the coming school year. Each summer, all new curriculum enters a full rollout cycle that includes training, model lessons, cycles of inquiry, and collaboration time to review formative assessments. This process assists the district to identify and address strengths and weaknesses in each of the above core curricular programs and adjust as necessary.  Teachers work closely with academic coaches assigned to each school to ensure the core curriculum is taught with fidelity and that lessons and assessments are aligned across the district.  Academic coaches model lessons for teachers to demonstrate exemplary educational delivery as needed.  Teachers are regularly surveyed to determine the greatest needs for district-level professional development.  Training is prioritized based on survey information as well as data collected from formative and summative assessments to build knowledge on programs or instructional methodology and delivery.  New teachers receive training on district programs and systems of support for student achievement.

A team of District teachers participated in Sonoma County Office of Education’s summer Tools for Transformation PD with other district teams to learn alongside one another and reflect deeply about transforming learning experiences for students in their systems. The Summer Institute employed an experiential, learn-by-doing approach that allowed us to explore new methods for tackling persistent problems of practice.  With regard to writing, the District continues to gather baseline data via district wide assessments on a biannual basis.  Annually teachers have 3 days contracted professional development days, weekly teacher collaboration time through student early release, and 8 additional opportunities for after school for district grade-level collaboration throughout the year.  District teachers use a variety of methods to meet the physical education needs of students, including the use of Integrated Perceptual Motor (IPM) equipment at both Meadow and Corona Creek.

19650940000000|West Covina Unified|2|During the 2018-2019 school year, the West Covina Unified School District made excellent progress in the implementation of recently adopted academic standards and/or curriculum frameworks. One hundred percent of students had appropriate State Board of Education standards-aligned materials as measured by district and school curriculum lists, and as reported to the local governing board. All students were provided with core textbooks and resources in subject areas of instruction allowing them to fully access California State Standards. Units of study aligned to California State Standards were also utilized as needed to address the specific needs of different grade levels and student groups to support teachers in instructional practices. There was full implementation of professional learning for teaching to the recently adopted academic standards and/or curriculum frameworks in English Language Arts, English Language Development, Mathematics, Next Generation Science Standards, and History-Social Science as measured by school administrator and teacher participation on curriculum adoption committees, professional development, and professional learning communities throughout the district. The professional learning needs of teachers and school administrators were surveyed during the school year to determine and guide professional development and collaborative time. A joint elementary and secondary science committee convened during the 2018-2019 school year to examine instructional materials based on the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The science committee determined not to make an instructional materials adoption recommendation and, instead, will reconvene at a later date to consider future instructional materials better aligned to the NGSS. A secondary mathematics committee made up of representatives from all secondary sites was also established during the 2018-2019 school year to select a more rigorous, standards-aligned mathematics curriculum to pilot. The committee will pilot the selected mathematics curriculum during the 2019-2020 school year to recommend for adoption to the local board, as appropriate. A secondary English language development (ELD) committee convened during the 2018-2019 school year to pilot and recommend instructional materials aligned to the California ELD Standards for adoption. National Geographic’s Inside, Edge, and Inside the USA were adopted by the local board. Academic standards in Health Education, Physical Education, Visual and Performing Arts, as well as World Languages were also implemented district-wide, with a particularly heavy emphasis on Career Technical Education, Visual and Performing Arts and World Languages at the high school level.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-22||Met|2019

34752830108860|Westlake Charter|2|Westlake Charter School continues to focus resources and time on fully implementing the state academic standards adopted by the State Board of Education.  As a locally selected measurement, Westlake Charter School (WCS) uses the NWEA MAP series of assessments to determine progress on the implementation of California State Standards. Students participate in NWEA MAP testing three times a year, and the instructional staff uses the nationally normed data to monitor student progress on ELA and math standards.  Additionally, NWEA provides information that helps to predict student performance on CAASPP. In 2018-19, WCS instructional staff created and vetted benchmark assessments for priority standards in math and ELA. These assessments monitor students’ progress on California State Standards. Additionally, WCS Instructional staff received professional development focused on Standards-Based Grading practices. These practices will be used during the 2019-20 school year to monitor students’ progress on California State Standards on a Standards-Based Report Card. Instructional staff meets weekly in grade-level meetings where the Professional Learning Communities (PLC) model is used to collaborate on standards, frameworks and student data.  In addition to Math and ELA standards, WCS staff focus on all academic standards adopted by the State Board of Education through backwards design work. WCS staff uses Wiggins’ Backwards Design model to create units of study integrating Next Generation Science and history/social science standards into units of study.  Teachers at WCS design thematic units of study where multiple subjects and standards are integrated into each unit of study.  These units, along with grade-level scope and sequences, are accessible to all staff on our school’s internal website.  WCS continues to develop professional development focused on ELD standards to support its EL students and the new ELPAC assessment. WCS has a .4 FTE Teacher on Special Assignment who focuses on ELD development and provides support to staff in classrooms, during grade-level PLC time and providing essential resources. At WCS, students use 1:1 technology to enhance instruction and address career and technical standards.  Furthermore, all students are enrolled in Spanish, art, and physical education classes in K-8th grade.  These courses are led by credentialed teachers and designed using the California State Standards.  WCS demonstrates strong progress in the implementation of content standards by continually investing in the professional development of its instructional staff.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2019-10-17||Met|2019

This way, they can identify where individual students are in learning the standard, then determining what instruction and which high leverage (.4+ Hattie effect size) instructional strategies will be used to teach students with rigor and relevance (ideally through project-based learning). After teaching the priority standards, teachers again ADT the post assessments to identify which students will need Tiered intervention support so that it can be provided to them according to where they fell in the learning progressions.
