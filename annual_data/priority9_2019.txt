01100170000000|Alameda County Office of Education|9|4|4|5|5|3|3|With efforts being put forth to incorporate intervention, culturally relevant teaching and restorative justice practices, districts are making efforts to reduce the number of expulsions that often represent students of color and/or lower socio-economic status. This impacts the student representation within the COE’s Community Schools as referrals are coming in at a slower rate than in previous years. However, the ACOE Community Schools still offer numerous opportunities for expelled youth to be re-admitted into their home districts, once referred. When students are referred during the second semester (or later) of their third year of high school, Student Programs and Services (SPAS) support youth through high school diploma programming or transitioning into an adult school or our very own Alameda County Opportunity Charter that serves disconnected youth and young adults. We have made a concerted effort to continue to build on partnerships with Local Education Agencies throughout the county by hosting a quarterly Student Services Council meeting where policy and regulatory issues are addressed and highlighted for implementation across districts.One, especially, critical issues has been around partial credit and the policies associated with ensuring that districts meet the requirements of California Education Code Section 48645 which requires each public school district and county office of education to accept for credit, full or partial coursework satisfactorily completed.|2019-10-15|Met|2019

03100330000000|Amador County Office of Education|9|4|4|5|5|5|2|Amador County Office of Education (ACOE) is committed to providing educational opportunities for all of our students, including our expelled youth, as evidenced by the recently updated Amador County Plan for Expelled Youth (2018-2021). ACOE strives to be proactive in the recognition of challenges students face and offering interventions prior to reaching expulsion. Interventions may include student study teams, academic and emotional assessments, parent meetings, restorative justice strategies, special education services, referral to after school activities, counseling, and student behavior contracts. In-school suspension and off-campus suspension are a final strategy. We offer several options for our expelled youth. Stipulated or suspended expulsion options may include placement at the student’s home school, another school in the county, or an Educational Options program. All of these placements include formal terms of probation, rehabilitation, behavior contract, and attendance in order for the student to continue. Expulsion options include referral to an ACOE Educational Options program. Expelled students will have an Individual Learning Plan developed by appropriate staff. Part of this plan may include return to the school of residence. Alternative placement and alternative strategies are developed, with the Court and Community School staff, for those students who have difficulty meeting the terms and conditions of their District designed rehabilitation plan.|2019-11-06|Met|2019

34103480000000|Sacramento County Office of Education|9|5|5|5|5|5|5|One of SCOE's greatest strengths is its coordination of services for expelled students. SCOE is proud of its consistently high Successful Transitions Rate, 95% in 2018-19. Metric indicators include systematized validation of timely records transfers, HiSET passing rates, and the percentage of students earning a high school diploma. Each student referred to our programs participates in an extensive enrollment process to identify needed services such as English Language Development, special education services, and/or foster youth,homeless, or former court school student status.  Upon completion, a centralized Registrar contacts the appropriate departments within SCOE to ensure appropriate services are immediately in place. This includes coordination of any outside services and supports that may be needed such as drug and alcohol counseling, anger management classes, mental health services, and possibly parenting classes for teen parents. SCOE administrators lead or participate in many multi-agency teams that lead service delivery for expelled students. This is done in cooperation with district placement officers, child welfare professionals, juvenile courts judges and staff, and mental health agencies. Each team meets quarterly to share data and coordinate instruction of expelled students.|2019-10-15|Met|2019

The council completed a three-year revision of the Plan for Expelled Students in July 2018.  SCOE supports the continuum of services for expelled students with its Golden Hills Community School (GHCS).  The plan is evaluated every year to address any emerging issues and evaluate ongoing practices.  The plan we developed in collaboration with our school districts does not include an agreement for partial credits.  Students who are expelled and attend districts’ community day schools or our GHCS re-enter their school of residence at semester end allowing them to complete their courses before transferring.  The transition from our SCOE programs to the districts of residence is facilitated and supported by our student support specialists who work with receiving districts and schools to provide a smooth transition for students.
